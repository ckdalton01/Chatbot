Browser Crashes when uploading a large number of files using the Cloud portal Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud I have a folder named \"MyFolder\" that contains 3,000 files, totaling 3GB. This folder needs to be available in the cache folder alongside the installer during installation. However, when I try uploading these files to a Custom App or as Extra Files for a deployment using the Patch My PC (PMPC) portal, my browser crashes. When too many concurrent worker operations occur during file uploads to either Custom Apps or even as Extra Files for a deployment, the browser's performance is significantly impacted, leading to freezing and eventual crashing. This is due to inherent limitations and is not related to the PMPC Cloud Portal but rather to browser performance constraints. To mitigate this, PMPC has limited the number of files that can be uploaded at once to 1,000. If you try to upload more than 1000 files at once, the upload will fail with the error message You have selected too many files (available: 1000) If you need to upload more than 1,000 files in one go, we recommend using the following workaround to compress them into a ZIP file and upload just this ZIP file as an Extra File. Then, when you deploy the app, you can configure a Pre-Installation script using the example below to extract the files. Consider the scenario mentioned above, where you have a folder named \"MyFolder\" containing 3,000 files totaling 3GB. This folder should be available in the cache folder alongside the installer during installation. Note If your scenario differs from the above, you should adjust the example scripts, ensuring you thoroughly test them. We provide no support for them or accept any liability for their use, which you do at your own risk. Please test these scripts thoroughly outside of the PMPC portal to ensure they work as expected before using them in your instance of the portal. Use the following PowerShell script to create a ZIP file. In this example, the folder to be compressed is located atC:\\Temp\\MyFolder Define the path to the folder you want to compress $sourceFolderPath = \"C:\\temp\\MyFolder\" Define the path where the zip archive should be created $zipFilePath = \"C:\\Temp\\MyFolder.zip\" Create the zip archive Compress-Archive -Path $sourceFolderPath -DestinationPath $zipFilePath -Force -ErrorAction 'Stop' After running this script, a file namedC:\\Temp\\MyFolder.zipwill be created. Create your Custom App or upload the ZIP archive as anExtra Filein a deployment. During the app deployment step, specify a script to extract the ZIP archive in the same folder. The script below uses the$PSScriptRootautomatic variable to determine the correct extraction path. Note $PSScriptRootis an automatic variable in PowerShell that represents the folder where the script is located. This ensures the ZIP file is extracted in the same location as the installation files. # Define the path to the zip file $zipFilePath = Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath 'MyFolder.zip' # Define the destination path $destinationPath = $PSScriptRoot # Extract the ZIP archive Expand-Archive -Path $zipFilePath -DestinationPath $destinationPath -Force -ErrorAction 'Stop' Upload the extraction script as a Pre-Install Script in your deployment settings. Finalize your deployment configuration. Finalize your deployment configuration. Test the deployment on a few machines before rolling it out to production.

How the Sync Schedule in Cloud affects Update Rings Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud As theSync Scheduleaffects when your portal checks for updates to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployments, how often it runs can also affect how your Update Rings behave. For example, if you have deployed an app that updates more frequently than your configured Sync Schedule, the ring with the lowest delay (for example Ring 1) will have the latest suitable version applied. Depending on how often you run your Sync Schedule and the delay between your rings, the scenario could arise where we have to skip versions to keep everything configured as per your ring strategy. If this arises, we will not deploy a version of an app to any rings that has not been deployed to at least Ring 1. This ensures we only deploy apps to later rings that have been tested on at least one ring. Also: If you create your Update Rings with anImmediatestart time, the Sync Schedule configuration only impacts the daily update of the rings and their assignments (promotion to the new version). If you create your Update Rings with anImmediatestart time, the Sync Schedule configuration only impacts the daily update of the rings and their assignments (promotion to the new version). If you create your Update Rings with theDelayedstart time, the Sync Schedule configuration impacts both the initial creation of the rings and the daily update of their assignments (promotion to the new version). For example, you create a deployment with two Update Rings with the default two-day delay between them. The first ring will be created when you deploy the software. The second ring won\u2019t be created until two days have passed since the time the deployment was created and the next Sync Schedule run. If you create your Update Rings with theDelayedstart time, the Sync Schedule configuration impacts both the initial creation of the rings and the daily update of their assignments (promotion to the new version). For example, you create a deployment with two Update Rings with the default two-day delay between them. The first ring will be created when you deploy the software. The second ring won\u2019t be created until two days have passed since the time the deployment was created and the next Sync Schedule run. The following table summarizes how yourSync Scheduleconfiguration determines how you can configure the delay between Update Rings. Daily Delays between rings can be configured as required. Weekly Ring 2 has to have a minimum delay of 7 days Ring x has to be configured with a delay of at least 7 days apart from any other ring. Monthly Ring 2 cannot have a delay of less than 31 days Ring x has to be configured with a delay of at least 31 days apart from any other ring. These limitations ensure that the update delays align with your chosen sync frequency and is why we advise configuring yourSync Scheduleto run on a daily basis when using Update Rings.

This report includes the following information about each app: Name Name Version Version Device count (how many devices the app is installed on) Device count (how many devices the app is installed on) Vendor i.e. who publishes the app. Vendor i.e. who publishes the app. We then perform a mapping process of the report\u2019s contents (based on the Intune app name and app version properties) to check if each app matches a publicly available app in our App Catalog or any Custom/Binary Free Apps you have uploaded. If there is a match, the app is marked as either: Unmanaged \u2013Apps identified as being in our App Catalog but aren\u2019t currently managed by us as there is no matching deployment in our portal. Unmanaged \u2013Apps identified as being in our App Catalog but aren\u2019t currently managed by us as there is no matching deployment in our portal. Managed \u2013Apps identified as being in our App Catalog and where there is a matching deployment in our portal created by either PMPC Cloud or our on-prem Publisher. Managed \u2013Apps identified as being in our App Catalog and where there is a matching deployment in our portal created by either PMPC Cloud or our on-prem Publisher. Note If an Intune app is discovered that maps to two different products from our App Catalog, if one of them is managed and the other is unmanaged, the managed app is displayed in theManagedtab and the unmanaged app is hidden in theUnmanagedtab. Also, when our scan runs, no event is written to the Events node. Any matching apps are shown on the relevant tab of theDiscoverynode. Tip If you look in theEventsnode, you will see theIntune Application Discoveredevent which is created the first time Discovery is run in your PMPC Company. Intune only updates its discovered apps report once a week. Because of this, PMPC Cloud will initially query Discovery data for your tenant once a week, randomly selecting a day between 1 AM and 5 AM based on the time zone of your PMPC company. All subsequent weekly updates will occur on the same day and time as the first discovery collection. Important If you create a deployment for anUnmanagedapp, you will only see it move to theManagedtab either: On the following Sunday (after the update scan runs) On the following Sunday (after the update scan runs) When you follow theRefresh Discovery Dataprocess. Note When our query runs, no event is written to theEventsnode. If you have any feedback or comments on our docs, please email[email protected]. Last updated15 days ago Was this helpful?"}

However, we do not display and enable this by default because if it's enabled and you lose access to your company for whatever reason, neither of us can regain access to that company.

Insights External Services HP Warranty (Workforce Experience) Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights Advanced Insights (this is not relevant for Patch Insights) can access device warranty information from a variety of vendors. For access to HP warranty information you will need to sign up to HP Workforce Experience, enroll all the HP devices you want to collect warranty data on and set up a developer account to access the warranty data. You will need to be a HP Workforce Experience customer for this to work, please speak to your HP representative about becoming a customer. First, we will create the developer account needed to interact with the HP Workforce Experience api. First, you will need to create an account if you do not have one already. If you have a HPID for HP Workforce Experience, you can use this account. Once you have registered, you will need to request access to the HP Proactive Insights APIs tech group for your developer account. The group required is HP Proactive Insights and not HP Warranty API. We do not currently support the HP Warranty API at this time. Please visit the link above to open the credentials generation page. You will be show the following options below.

If you are already a HP Workforce Experience customer, you may not need to do the registration steps below but you will need access to the HP Workforce Experience Portal. HP has two versions of HP Workforce Experience, one for US (and ASIA) customers and one for EU customers. You will need to sign up to the appropriate version based on your companies location. Mistakes here will cause issues in the future. Here are the access urls. When you have registered and logged in, you will be greeted by the home experience of HP Workforce Experience. On the left hand side, you will need to click \"Assets\" to begin importing your HP devices into HP Workforce Experience. HP Workforce Experience allows you to import your device using four different mechanisms. Currentlyonly Intune Import and Asset enrolment allow for warranty data collection, manual and csv upload do not trigger warranty collection by design. To begin importing devices, please click the \"Add\" button in the top left of the page. To begin importing from Intune, please click the Intune Import button then click next. You will be now asked to provide your Intune Domain Name, this can be found by going to the Intune portal, clicking Tenant Administration on the left hand menu and copying the Tenant name from the Tenant Status page. You will now be greeted by the Microsoft Login flow, please log in using your microsoft credenitals as normal. You will be then presented the list of permission HP requests to perform the Intune import. All of the permissions requested by HP is for the HP Workforce Experience platform. They are not defined/requested by Patch My PC. Advanced Insights does not use or read any of your Intune data. Once you have accepted the permission, the connection to Intune will be completed by HP. You will now be asked if you wish to import Assets from Intune Groups, or to import all of your assets. We recommend you use the Group functionality, as this allows you to only provide HP the devices you wish to collect warranty information on. Only use full import if you really want every device in HP Workforce Experience as it is vendor agnostic and will collect all competing vendor devices. We shall continue using Group import only. When you click on Import assets only from Intune groups, you will be presented with a full list of all your groups in Intune. You can filter out the groups you want to import and you can import multiple groups. Select the groups you want to import and click Import. Intune will now begin importing your selected devices. You will receive a notification on begin and completion of the import. You can also check progress by navigating to the logs link on the left hand side. To enrol your device by Asset Enrolment, please use the following HP documentation to distribute the agent. Once the devices are imported, HP Workforce Experience will begin collecting warranty information. This process can take some time, depending on how many devices you have imported. Collecting warranty in Advanced Insights works in the same way as the other providers, but you will need to log into HP on bulk caching. Navigate to the warranty dashboard. To begin, click the \"Bulk Processing\" statistic to begin re-caching warranty. You will be asked to log in to HP, click yes and Advanced Insights will go to HP to log in. If you receive a redirect url is incorrect error. Please go back to your developer app and check the redirect url provided. Once you have logged in, HP will redirect you back to Advanced Insights and warranty will begin caching warranty data. Last updated1 month ago Was this helpful?"}

Uninstall Cloud Branding Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud To uninstall any custom logos or localizations from your end-user devices installed by a Patch My PC (PMPC ) Cloud Branding App, you need to uninstall the relevant Branding App. Simplydeleting a Branding Apponly removes that Branding App from Intune. Creating anUninstall Branding Appcreates a Win32 app in Intune with aRequiredassignment with an uninstall intent, that will remove any PMPC Cloud custom branding files from the assigned devices. Important Each device can only have one Branding App installed. Even if you have multiple branding apps assigned to the same device, only the one that was installed last will be installed on the device. The script that the Uninstall Branding App runs removes the branding currently installed on the device. It does not check which specific branding was originally deployed. For example, if you assign the uninstall for Branding A, but the device now has Branding B, Branding B will be removed. This is why when you create an Uninstall Branding App, a new Win32 app is created that will uninstall any Branding App the targeted device may have installed. To uninstall a Branding app: Navigate toSettings | Branding Navigate toSettings | Branding On theBrandingscreen, make a note of the assignments for the branding app you want to uninstall.For example, if you plan to uninstall theBranding \u2013 Corel Usersbranding app, make a note of which resources it is assigned to by hovering overAssignmentsand noting the assignments (Corel All Usersin this example).

How Cloud Update Rings Handle New Versions Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Let\u2019s assume you want to deploy an app in a controlled manner using Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud. First, you want to deploy the software to a pilot group containing a few users who want to test the software. Then, a couple of days later, once you are happy the app functions correctly, you want to deploy it to a different group containing more users. You could: Create a single deployment targeted to the pilot users group. Create a single deployment targeted to the pilot users group. Two days later, either:Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users.Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. Two days later, either: Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users. Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users. Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. This approach is admin intensive and relies on the admin remembering to create the deployment two days later to ensure the other group containing more users gets the app. Alternatively, you can create a single deployment and enable Update Rings with: One ring assigned to the pilot users group. One ring assigned to the pilot users group. A separate ring assigned to the other group containing more users, but with a two-day delay to allow the pilot users to perform testing. A separate ring assigned to the other group containing more users, but with a two-day delay to allow the pilot users to perform testing. How Update Rings behave depends on which Update ring Start Time you chose at the time of creating the rings: For this example, we will assume you want to deploy version 2019.1 of dBase: Initially to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Initially to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to thedBase All Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to thedBase All Usersgroup. This is how you would configure this deployment in the PMPC Cloud portal to useDelayedupdate Rings. In this scenario, when you deploy the app theDeploymentsnode is displayed along with theSuccess \u2013 Created <app_name>notification. Once the deployment has been completed successfully, if you look in the Microsoft Intune admin center underAll appsand search for the app, you will see that version2019.1has been successfully deployed. If you click the app and navigate toManage | Properties, then scroll down to theAssignmentssection, as you are using delayed update rings you will only see the assignments for the first Update Ring has been created and applied to this version. If you click on the deployment in the portal, then clickMore Info, then clickRing 2, you will see that this ring is scheduled to be created two days after the deployment was created. Two days after the deployment was created and after the next Sync Schedule runs, the second update ring will be created and the assignment added for thedBase All Usersgroup to install the software to all of the members of this group. You can now edit the deployment if required, as all of the rings have been created. If you also look at the deployment's properties, you will see that the second ring has been created successfully and assigned to thedBase All Usersgroup. As the following table shows, the software is installed immediately for any users in thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Any users in thedBase All Usersgroup will not have the software installed until two days later. 0 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes No 1 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes No 2 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes Yes Now, let\u2019s assume a new version (2019.2) gets released. In this scenario, you can: Wait until the overnight sync runs to pick up the new version. Wait until the overnight sync runs to pick up the new version. Run theSync Nowprocess to update just this deployment immediately. Note This is one of the many reasons why we recommend configuring yourSync ScheduletoDailyif you are using Update Rings. We also use the release date of the new version to validate if it is the right time to update the assignments to upgrade rings to later versions. Once the deployment has been updated, you can now edit it as all of the rings have now been created. If you look at the deployment\u2019s properties, you will see that for theRing 1, version2019.2has now been assigned to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. But if you click onRing 2, you will see that version2019.1is still assigned to thedBase All Usersgroup. If you check in the Intune admin center, you will now see both the existing app (version 2019.1) and the new version we have just deployed (version 2019.2). If you check the assignments for the original deployment (version 2019.1), you will see it is now only assigned to thedBase All Usersgroup. Whereas, if you check the assignments for the new deployment (version 2019.2), you will see it is only assigned for now to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Two days after the new version of the app is released and after the next Sync Schedule runs, the assignment for thedBase All Usersgroup will be automatically moved from the version 2019.1 deployment to the 2019.2 deployment, automatically upgrading the members of thedBase All Usersgroup to version 2019.2. The old version of the app (2019.1), will remain, but will no longer show asYesunder theAssignedcolumn in the Intune admin center. At the next sync, the old version of the app will be deleted. This update process is summarized in the following table: 0 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users 2019.1 2019.1 Yes No 2019.2 2019.1 1 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users 2019.2 2019.1 No** No 2019.2 2019.1 2 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users 2019.2 2019.1 No** Yes 2019.2 2019.1 * Number of days after the new version of the app is released ** Any new users/devices added to the group will receive the version applicable to the group. For this example, we will assume you want to deploy version 2024.1 of PaintShop Pro: Initially to theCorel Pilot Usersgroup. Initially to theCorel Pilot Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to theCorel All Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to theCorel All Usersgroup.

ConfigMgr Apps Getting started with Configuration Manager Apps. Please note, this portion of the guide is for base installations. For more in depth recommendations check out our configuration guides. Applies to: On-premises Publisher To activate any of the tabs in Patch My PC Publisher, the corresponding checkbox must be checked. If you do not check this option the product selection tree for the corresponding tab cannot be used. If you are using theConfigMgr Appstab, these options areNOToptional. You must configure them to be able to create applications. The application Options button has a lot of different features. This installation guide willnot cover the options in detailbut instead give you a quick, straightforward guide to getting the product installed. For more detailed documentation, click themore infolinks in the Publisher. Let's get started to begin, click theOptions buttonnext to the enablement checkbox. This will load the options panel in the Publisher. First Select the ConfigureSMS Provider connection. This is how you will ensure that the system where the Publisher is installed has access to the configuration manager site. Defining the SMS Provider is required, and it lets the Publisher know how to talk to your ConfigMgr site to create applications and trigger a software update point sync. By default, when a synchronization, the service will connect to ConfigMgr using SYSTEM context. Note: When running the Publisher, the ConfigMgr connection will be under the context of the user running the Publisher. After clicking theConfigureoption, the below pop-up will appear. Once you enter the name of the server selectTestto validate the configuration. Important: The connection to the SMS Provider is performed using theSYSTEM accountof the server where the Publisher is installed. If the server that the Publisher is installed on is remote from the SMS Provider, the SYSTEM Account of the Publisher server may need to be added to the SMS Admins Group, or DCOM permissions may need to be updated (More info) In the event the test result fails, you will instead see the following message. If the connection fails, clickCreate ConfigMgr Security Roleto automatically create a new security role with the minimum required permissions. Please see the article below for more details. Tip: If you need to create the security role, you will need to manually add the computer account to the role after it's automatically created as describedhere. Once you have completed a successful connection to the SMS provider selectOKto finalize the configuration. Next, you'll want to provide aUNC share to store the application content. This path needs to be accessible by the computer account of the machine running the publisher as well as the ConfigMgr site server, or a dedicated service account Important: As the Patch My PC Publisher will run in the SYSTEM context, therefore computer account the Publisher is installed on will need WRITE permissions to the share configured for source content of ConfigMgr Apps. When you choose a path, we will create a sub-folder calledApplicationsand then create a folder for eachvendorandproductin use. Keep this in mind when selecting the UNC path you will use to store source files. The above configuration would create the belowfolder structure similar to the structure below. Below are the default settings which will work fine for most setups. Our product provides a lot of customization options. To learn the details about all items on this page, check out thearticle below. Once you have the base options selected, you are ready to check out a simple application for testing. We recommend using 7-zip. Its small size makes it ideal for testing. Use the search icon in the bottom right or theCtrl+Fkey combination to search forIgor SelectApply.

A very common issue in many organizations is that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Security team receive a lot of information from different sources, some of which is irrelevant. Once they\u2019ve worked out what is relevant, determining what actually needs to be done to address the CVE can be confusing, plus they don\u2019t have an easy way of checking if an applicable patch is available for a CVE and whether that patch has been deployed to their environment.

Overview of Advanced Insights Inventory Extension Technical detail for the Inventory Extensions Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights The Inventory Extensions MSI is a .NETWMI Provider. This provider code is loaded by theWMI Serviceon Windows clients. The provider returns data that the client processes into a hardware inventory report where it is then submitted to the ConfigMgr site server and entered into the SQL database. WMIstands forWindows Management Instrumentation. It is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and applications in a network from Windows-based systems. WMI provides a standardized way for systems administrators to manage and query information about their systems. The heart ofWMIis theWMI Service, known asWinmgmtand part of the Windows OS, this service runs in the background on all Windows systems. This service acts as a broker betweenWMI Clients(ConfigMgr client) and theWMI Providers(Inventory Extensions MSI) that deliver the actual data. ConfigMgr's existing hardware inventory data is collected fromWMI. We simply extend ConfigMgr's default hardware inventory policy with the new definitions of our Inventory Extensions data. This allows the ConfigMgr clients to query ourWMI Providerthrough theWMI Serviceduring its normal hardware inventory task - just like it would for any existing hardware inventory class. For this reasonwe do not consider the Inventory Extensions MSI as an \"Agent\". We do not install any services on clients, instead the existing WMI Service brokers the connection between our Inventory Extension MSI code and the ConfigMgr client for us. The only time this code runs on clients is during a Hardware Inventory task or when a custom client action is invoked, after which theWMI Servicehandles the unloading of ourWMI Provider.

Create an MSP App Set Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Important This documentation is under construction. Once it is finalized, this banner will be removed. Creating an App Set is a two-stage process that involves defining: Note We do not recommend creating a single App Set that you use to deploy all of the required apps to your customers. Instead, you should consider creating separate App Sets by app function, e.g., core apps (apps that should be installed or available everywhere), utilities that should only be deployed to certain groups or users, etc. Adopting this approach reduces the impact of working with App Sets on your infrastructure and that of your child companies. Plus, if someone accidentally deletes the wrong App Set, the impact on the targeted users will be reduced, and the time taken to recreate and redeploy the App Set will be reduced. To define which apps to include in the App Set: Navigate toApp SetsTheApp Setspage shows any existing App Sets. Navigate toApp Sets TheApp Setspage shows any existing App Sets. ClickAdd App Set ClickAdd App Set On theAdd App Setscreen, enter a unique name for the new App Set in theApp Set Namefield and clickAddThe App Set is created and the<appset_name>screen opens (where<appset_name>is the name of the App Set). On theAdd App Setscreen, enter a unique name for the new App Set in theApp Set Namefield and clickAddThe App Set is created and the<appset_name>screen opens (where<appset_name>is the name of the App Set). Tip You can clickEdit Namebeside the App Set name if you want to rename it. To add an application to this App Set, clickAdd Application To add an application to this App Set, clickAdd Application Note You can add up to 100 apps per App Set, but each app can only be added to an App Set once. You can also add anMSP Custom Appto an App Set, provided that app has been created and assigned to all customers. On theGeneral Informationpage, select the relevant app you want to add from theSelect Applicationdropdown or start typing its name. On theGeneral Informationpage, select the relevant app you want to add from theSelect Applicationdropdown or start typing its name. Note Only apps that have been deployed successfully will appear in theSelect Applicationdropdown. An MSP Custom App will only appear in theSelect Applicationdropdown if it has been added and assigned to all customers. If the Custom App has only been assigned to a specific customer or only to the MSP, it will not appear in the dropdown. In theDisplay Namefield, we suggest you add the name of the App Set as a suffix.For example, if the App Set\u2019s name isCore Appsand you are deploying Adobe Acrobat Pro, we recommend changing theDisplay Namefrom justAdobe Acrobat ProtoAdobe Acrobat Pro \u2013 Core Apps. In theDisplay Namefield, we suggest you add the name of the App Set as a suffix. For example, if the App Set\u2019s name isCore Appsand you are deploying Adobe Acrobat Pro, we recommend changing theDisplay Namefrom justAdobe Acrobat ProtoAdobe Acrobat Pro \u2013 Core Apps. Note The reason for the above recommendations is that by default, when an app in an App Set is deployed, if the app has already been deployed in your company, we automatically add the_AppSet<number>suffix (for example_AppSet7) to the deployment\u2019s name, where<number>is the next available sequential number. This is because all deployment names need to be unique. So in our Acrobat example, the default deployment name would be something like: Adobe Acrobat Pro_AppSet7 This is potentially confusing as you won\u2019t know which deployment belongs to which App Set. We are working on improving this.

You can add multiple companies to an App Set and to the same set of Update Rings. A child customer also doesn\u2019t need to be present in all rings. For example, if you create four Update Rings for an App Set, but a child customer only requires two rings, you only need to add that child customer to the two relevant rings. On the child customer side, only the rings they are part of will be created in the child company, not all four rings defined in the App Set.

Tip You and the admins at the child company can monitor the status of each individual deployment from theDeploymentsnode of the targeted company. Important You cannotEditorDeletea deployment from theDeploymentsnode if it belongs to an App Set (these options are unavailable when clicking on the ellipsis (\u22ee) beside the deployment). This is another reason for adding the App Set\u2019s name as a suffix to the app\u2019sDisplay Nameso that when you are viewing all of your deployments, you and the admins at your child companies can easily identify which deployment belongs to an App Set. Once the App Set has been deployed successfully, it will show aStatusofSuccesson theApp Setspage. Note Once successfully created, any deployments created as part of an App Set will be updated based on the Sync Schedule configured at each child customer. So even if you have a single App Set with deployments to multiple child customers, you can end up with different versions of the same app at different child customers depending on when theSync Scheduleruns.

Specifically for Intune detection and requirement scripts,AgentExecutor.exe(the Intune client process responsible for calling Win32 app detection or requirement scripts) runs in session 0; it is not visible by the logged on user and PowerShell is awaiting input by the user to accept the code-signing certificate. After 60 minutes, the Intune Management Extension service will timeout and terminate thepowershell.exeprocess with the below log entries in theIntuneManagementExtension.log. Note Microsoft do not expose this timeout to be configurable in Intune. PMPC utilizes \"helper\" scripts to perform both required and recommended pre/post actions for certain applications in the PMPC catalog. These helper scripts can, but are not limited to, help remove old versions of software if the vendor's installer does not handle this automatically. You have two ways to deploy either certificate from Intune: Note Important In addition, the computer must trust the certificate chain for the code-signing certificate, which is generally the case with certificates issued by public CAs. By importing the code-signing certificate's public key into the Trusted Publishers store, you ensure PowerShell can successfully verify and run the signed scripts.

Create a Cloud Deployment Without Assignments Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Some large organizations want to be able to create deployments in Intune Apps for Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud without any assignments. Then, their local IT organization adds and manages the assignments to the relevant deployments to meet their needs by using Intune admin center. To create a deployment with no assignments: Follow theDeploy an Appprocess until you reach theAssignmentstab where you can add an assignment. When you clickAdd Assignment, you will see theApp Without Assignmentsub-menu containing the following two items:\u2022 Install App -Allows the Intune admin to addRequired,Available, orUninstallassignments from within the Intune admin center. \u2022Update Only App -Allows the Intune admin to add only anUpdate Onlyassignment from within the Intune admin center. Note If you are deploying a Microsoft patch file (.msp), only theUpdate Only Appoption is shown under theApp Without Assignmentsection as.mspfiles cannot be used to install an app, only update it. Tip You can alsoAdd a Templatewith theApp Without Assignmentsoptions configured. Then when you create the deployment, simply clickApply Templateand select the relevant template to have its settings applied to this deployment. Select the relevant option.

Once the deployment has successfully completed, if you look in the Intune admin center you will see that the app has been created without any assignments. Your local IT teams can now follow theAssign apps to groups with Microsoft Intuneprocess to add the relevant assignments for this app. Note If you checked theCopy-Forwardcheckbox, the next time the Sync Schedule detects a new version, the assignments are copied forward to the new version. The old version of the app will be removed immediately once the new version has been created and the assignments moved over to it. Also, a deployment without assignments can be edited and managed in the same way as a regular deployment. See theManage UpdatesandManage Deploymentssections for more details. Important The current release of this feature has the following restrictions: A deployment cannot contain both regular assignment types and no assignment types.

How Cloud Update Rings Are Created Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Update Ringsin Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud provides two different implementations, both of which depend on the start time of the relevant deployment and how you have your Sync Schedule configured: TheDelayedoption works as follows: The first Update Ring is created immediately and the software is deployed to the assigned test users/devices (usually known as apilot group). The first Update Ring is created immediately and the software is deployed to the assigned test users/devices (usually known as apilot group). After waiting the configured number of days from when the deployment was created (to allow testing to be performed), the next Update Ring is created, and the software is deployed to the assigned users/devices (usually a bigger group/all assigned users/devices). After waiting the configured number of days from when the deployment was created (to allow testing to be performed), the next Update Ring is created, and the software is deployed to the assigned users/devices (usually a bigger group/all assigned users/devices). Step 2 is repeated until all Update Rings have been created and the software has been deployed to all users/devices requiring it. Step 2 is repeated until all Update Rings have been created and the software has been deployed to all users/devices requiring it. The advantage of the delayed option is: As the next ring (and therefore the next set of assignments) has not been created, if the software causes an issue that is detected in the first ring, the issue cannot propagate to other rings as they haven\u2019t been created.

If the ConfigMgr console is installed on the user\u2019s computer then no additional configuration is required. To run the ConfigMgr remote control agent we need a copy of: CmRcViewer.exe CmRcViewer.exe RdpCoreSccm.dll RdpCoreSccm.dll the relevant locale folder for the RC Tools, for example 00000409 the relevant locale folder for the RC Tools, for example 00000409 All of these are copied from \\\\SiteServerName\\SMS_ABC\\AdminConsole\\bin\\i386 On each Advanced Insight user\u2019s computer, copy these files and folder to a location accessible by the user, for example C:\\CMTools or %AppData%\\CMRCtools. We also need a copy of the Advanced Insights utility AdvInsRemoteControl.exe stored in the same location. The user is prompted to download and run this from the Advanced Insights portal the first time they try to use remote control if the app has not already been executed. AdvInsRemoteControl.exe is included with the installation of Advanced Insights in the folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Advanced Insights\\Api\\Installers. It is a DotNet Core application which handles calling the Configuration Manager Remote Control utility from the Advanced Insights website. On first run AdvInsRemoteControl.exe registers itself in the Registry as a class type underComputer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\cmrc This allows the Advanced Insights website to invoke the ConfigMgr Remote Control agent when required. If you delete or move the AdvInsRemoteControl.exe you can reregister it simply by running it again from Windows Explorer.

Note Detection uses this field to determine if the app is installed by looking for a matchingDisplayNameentry in the following registry key: HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall As this field allows a \"%\" wildcard (which matches on any string of characters), consider replacing the version number with this wildcard if the version number is in theApps & Features Name. This will allow App Detection and Update Requirement rules to detect older versions of the app on your endpoints. Important As theApps & Features Nameis used to determine applicability and detection, using an overly generic name may cause Intune Updates to be detected as required on devices without the software installed. Configure any additional required options from those listed below. Configure any additional required options from those listed below. Install Context Controls the context in which the app is installed, either SYSTEM orUser. Architecture Specifies the architecture for the app, either64-bitor32-bit.

MSI Product Code Applies to MSI installers only. The MSI Product Code for this app, which is used for detection. NOTE If the MSI Product Code for your installer does not update between versions, the Custom Apps Detection and Applicability rules will: \u2022 Not detect any changes and no updates will not be installed. \u2022 Detect the MSI app, even if an older version is installed. To work around this issue, change the MSI Product Code to all0's (00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000) when creating the Custom App. This forces the detection and applicability scripts to fall back to DisplayName and DisplayVersion detection.

In the Administration node you will find the \u201cAudit logs\u201d area. This lists all activities in the Advanced Insights portal. The list is filterable by user and can be exported. You can now create new ConfigMgr collections using Advanced Insights. The Resources - Collections page has a \"Create New Collection\" button. You can also create a collection from a device list and automatically add the selected clients to a new collection or add to an existing collection. We have added a new function to allow you to delete profiles from client devices. This is useful in support scenarios for outdated or orphaned profiles. The delete action is also available in the device view - Users - User Profiles. For customers with BitLocker MBAM integrated with Configuration Manager we will now allow you to view the BitLocker Recovery Key in Advanced Insights. Users must have the relevant permission in their Advanced Insights role. The key is accessible via the Device View - Hardware - Disks tab. We now support the export of any of the tables in the device view. The new Configuration Manager console extension brings Advanced Insights right into the ConfigMgr console. Full documentation and download is herehttps://docs.patchmypc.com/installation-guides/advanced-insights-and-patch-insights/configuration-manager-console-extension We have included a new Log Builder application, this is integrated into the Installer wrapper and will execute automatically on failure. It can also be run manually from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Advanced Insights\\Api\\LogCollector\\AdvancedInsightsLogDiag.exe. When run it creates a zip file on the desktop with environment details and logs to aid Patch My PC Support in troubleshooting.

This is a major release. Users can now create a dashboard of their own items from all viewable items for their role. For example, a user can create a dashboard with objects from Resources, Hardware, Software Updates Trend, OSD, all in one view. Custom dashboards can also be shared with other users or roles (permissions permitting). We have made hundreds of SQL Cardinality statements to ensure SQL performance is consistent across different SQL Cardinality levels.

Can now reset Admin password using Modify option in Add/Remove Programs. Can also change certificate, CNAME and port number with this option. Prior to this release Software Metering reports required the legacy Configuration Manager Software Inventory Agent to be enabled and performing inventory of any executable you wished to report Metering data for. This is no longer the case, Advanced Insights now uses the InstalledExecutable class, which is part of the Asset Intelligence inventory provider. The legacy Software Inventory agent can be disabled if you were only using it to enable Metering reporting. Fixed bug with \"Patch My PC Actions\" not working for some customers. Look and feel clean-up Updated dependencies and DotNet version to DotNet 8. DotNet 7 components can now be removed from Advanced Insights servers (if not required by other applications).

The following are the currentrequirementsfor using certificate-based authentication that apply to both purchased and self-signed certificates:- A 2048-bit key length. While longer values are supported, the 2048-bit size is highly recommended for the best combination of security and performance. A 2048-bit key length.

Retention Policy (Deployments) Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Note Using theRetention Policytool is optional and is not supported by the MSP App Sets feature. TheRetention Policytool of the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployment wizard allows you to determine how many versions of an app (both Windows and macOS) you want to keep. If deploying a later version of an app causes issues, you can redeploy an older version. By default, PMPC only retains the latest version of an app in your environment. Configuring a Retention Policy allows you to keep the current version, plus the number of configured versions as set by the Retention Policy. For example, setting a Retention Policy of 1 for Google Chrome would mean you always haven-1versions of Chrome, the latest and the previous version, until a newer version is deployed. To configure a PMPC Cloud deployment to use a Retention Policy: Click theRetention Policytool. Click theRetention Policytool. Scroll down to theRetention Policysection.

Dependencies (Deployments) Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Note Using theDepenciestool is optional. TheDependenciestool of the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployment wizard allows you to create dependencies within a deployment, whereby the app being deployed requires one or more other apps to have already been installed on the targeted resource before it can be deployed. If the required app(s) (known as theparent) has not already been installed on the device, they will automatically be installed before the app that is being deployed (known as thechild app) is installed. Important Before you can create an App Dependency in a PMPC Cloud deployment, the deployment for the parent app(s) must: exist already exist already have been deployed successfully have been deployed successfully Also, apps that have not been successfully deployed (such as those with a status ofFailed,Retrying,Processing, etc.) cannot be used to create an app dependency, nor can apps withUninstallorUpdate Onlyassignments. Note Like Intune, we do not support circular dependencies (i.e. App A has a dependency on App B, and App B has a dependency on App A). As per Intune, you can create a maximum of 100 dependencies, which includes the dependencies of any included dependencies, as well as the app itself. SeeStep 5: DependenciesofAdd, assign, and monitor a Win32 app in Microsoft Intunefor more information. Note The parent app must have been deployed successfully before you can create a dependency between apps. To add a dependency: Click theDependenciestool. Click theDependenciestool.

Note If a dependency is set up in the Intune admin center between an app managed by PMPC Cloud and an app managed directly in Intune, we will always copy-forward any dependencies from the PMPC Cloud app whenever we update the PMPC Cloud app. Warnings If we encounter any problems with app dependencies, we display a yellow exclamation mark (\u201c!\u201d) warning.

If you are already a HP Workforce Experience customer, you may not need to do the registration steps below but you will need access to the HP Workforce Experience Portal. HP has two versions of HP Workforce Experience, one for US (and ASIA) customers and one for EU customers. You will need to sign up to the appropriate version based on your companies location. Mistakes here will cause issues in the future. Here are the access urls. When you have registered and logged in, you will be greeted by the home experience of HP Workforce Experience. On the left hand side, you will need to click \"Assets\" to begin importing your HP devices into HP Workforce Experience. HP Workforce Experience allows you to import your device using four different mechanisms. Currentlyonly Intune Import and Asset enrolment allow for warranty data collection, manual and csv upload do not trigger warranty collection by design. To begin importing devices, please click the \"Add\" button in the top left of the page. To begin importing from Intune, please click the Intune Import button then click next. You will be now asked to provide your Intune Domain Name, this can be found by going to the Intune portal, clicking Tenant Administration on the left hand menu and copying the Tenant name from the Tenant Status page. You will now be greeted by the Microsoft Login flow, please log in using your microsoft credenitals as normal. You will be then presented the list of permission HP requests to perform the Intune import. All of the permissions requested by HP is for the HP Workforce Experience platform. They are not defined/requested by Patch My PC. Advanced Insights does not use or read any of your Intune data. Once you have accepted the permission, the connection to Intune will be completed by HP. You will now be asked if you wish to import Assets from Intune Groups, or to import all of your assets. We recommend you use the Group functionality, as this allows you to only provide HP the devices you wish to collect warranty information on. Only use full import if you really want every device in HP Workforce Experience as it is vendor agnostic and will collect all competing vendor devices. We shall continue using Group import only. When you click on Import assets only from Intune groups, you will be presented with a full list of all your groups in Intune. You can filter out the groups you want to import and you can import multiple groups. Select the groups you want to import and click Import. Intune will now begin importing your selected devices. You will receive a notification on begin and completion of the import. You can also check progress by navigating to the logs link on the left hand side. To enrol your device by Asset Enrolment, please use the following HP documentation to distribute the agent. Once the devices are imported, HP Workforce Experience will begin collecting warranty information. This process can take some time, depending on how many devices you have imported. Collecting warranty in Advanced Insights works in the same way as the other providers, but you will need to log into HP on bulk caching. Navigate to the warranty dashboard. To begin, click the \"Bulk Processing\" statistic to begin re-caching warranty. You will be asked to log in to HP, click yes and Advanced Insights will go to HP to log in. If you receive a redirect url is incorrect error. Please go back to your developer app and check the redirect url provided. Once you have logged in, HP will redirect you back to Advanced Insights and warranty will begin caching warranty data. Last updated1 month ago Was this helpful?"}
