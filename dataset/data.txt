The Software UpdatesDeployment EvaluationCycleinSCCMis a setting thatdetermineshowfrequentlyclient devices evaluate whether they have the required software updates installed. This is critical in ensuring devices areup-to-datewith security patches and other important updates as required by the organization. The component evaluation serves a vital purpose by ensuring that clients regularly check and verify the installation status of software updates deployed to them. If an update is missing or was not successfully installed, the evaluation process detects this and prompts the client to attempt the installation again, following the deployment configurations. This ensures compliance and helps maintain the integrity of the update deployment process. What does it do?

Automatic RemediationIf an update fails or is missing, the evaluation schedule will detect this and reattempt installation without requiring manual intervention. Automatic RemediationIf an update fails or is missing, the evaluation schedule will detect this and reattempt installation without requiring manual intervention. How the cycle works The SCCM client initiates theSoftware Update Deployment Evaluation Cycleon a predefined schedule (default is every 7 days). During each cycle, the client: Contacts the SCCM Management PointThe client connects to the SCCM management point to retrieve the list of available updates based on the policies and deployment configurations defined in SCCM. Downloads Update PoliciesThe client downloads any update-related policies, which include details about required updates, installation deadlines, user interaction settings, and deployment configurations. Evaluates Update ComplianceThe client compares the list of required updates with the updates already installed on the device. During this evaluation:Missing UpdatesIdentifies updates that are required but not yet installed.Failed UpdatesFlags updates that were previously attempted but failed to install.Outdated UpdatesDetects updates that need to be replaced by newer, superseding updates. Missing UpdatesIdentifies updates that are required but not yet installed. Failed UpdatesFlags updates that were previously attempted but failed to install. Outdated UpdatesDetects updates that need to be replaced by newer, superseding updates. Flags Updates for ActionBased on the evaluation, the client flags any updates that need to be installed or reinstalled. This ensures all required updates are identified for remediation. Downloads Required UpdatesFor flagged updates, the client begins downloading the necessary files from the designated distribution point. This process adheres to bandwidth settings and preferred caching locations. Installs Updates as ConfiguredAfter downloading, the client initiates the installation process for the required updates. It respects SCCM deployment rules, such as:Installation during a defined maintenance window.Enforcement of restart policies.Handling of user interaction prompts (if required). Installation during a defined maintenance window. Enforcement of restart policies. Handling of user interaction prompts (if required). Reports Compliance StatusOnce the updates are installed, the client verifies the installation and reports the compliance status back to the SCCM server. This information includes details about successfully installed, pending, or failed updates, allowing administrators to monitor and address compliance gaps. Ways to manually invoke theSoftware Update Deployment EvaluationCycle Although the cycle runs automatically, administrators can also manually trigger it on individual clients to speed up policy application. There are numerous ways this can be invoked manually. 1. From the Client Side One method is by using the Control PanelConfiguration ManagerApplet: Open theControl Panelon the client device. Go toSystem and Security> Configuration Manager. In the Actions tab, selectSoftware Update Deployment EvaluationCycleand clickRun Now. 2.

This article provides a breakdown of what the policy does, how to invoke it and which logs to use for troubleshooting. What is theMachine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle? The Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle inConfigMgris a process through whichtheSCCM client devices check for new or updated policies and evaluate their applicability. This cycledetermineswhat actions the client needs to perform based on the policies assigned by the ConfigMgr server. What does it do? The Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle is essential for keeping SCCM client settings up to date. It helps enforce configuration policies, software deployments, compliance settings, and other management tasks. The cycle enables the client to periodically communicate with the SCCM server to download any new policies or updates, apply those policies, and determine any required actions. This process ensures that the client remains aligned with IT policies and software distribution schedules set by administrators. How the cycle works The SCCM client initiates the Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle on a predefined schedule (default is every 60 minutes). During each cycle, the client: Contacts the SCCM Management PointThe client requests updated policy information from the SCCM management point. Downloads PoliciesIf there are new or modified policies, the client downloads them. These policies may include settings, configurations, deployments, or compliance rules. Evaluates PoliciesAfter downloading, the client evaluates the policies to see if there are any specific actions it needs to take.

An error occurred while getting the SDP: The specified item could not be found in the database. Why Does this Logging Error Line Occur? When migrating to a new Software Update Point (WSUS Server), companies will often add a new SUP that initially synchronizes with the original SUP. Once the new software update point is synchronized, the original SUP is removed from the site, andthe new SUP is set as the primary SUP. A small subset of metadata for third-party updates doesn\u2019tsynchronize during this process, resulting in this error line in thePatchMyPC.logwhen we query already published updates. Important:The third-party updates will still scan and install successfully on client devices. This log line can be ignored.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/wsus-compliance-over-100/", "title": "", "raw_text": "WSUS Compliance \u2013 Installed / Not Applicable Exceeds 100% Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) administrators may occasionally encounter a puzzling scenario where the Installed / Not Applicable column percentages exceed 100%. This anomaly can be confusing and lead to questions about data compliance integrity . Determine if You are Affected In a standalone WSUS configuration, where the Configuration Manager Software Update Point (SUP) site system role is not configured, administrators rely on the WSUS console for reporting. To analyze update compliance for individual computers, follow these steps: Open the WSUS Console Navigate to the \u201cAll Computers\u201d node or a specific Computer Group. The computer status summary will display multiple columns, some of which may be hidden by default. Right-click any column header and select additional columns to include:Installed/Not Applicable Percentage \u2013 Displays the percentage of updates that are installed out of those marked as applicable.Needed Count \u2013 The number of updates that are required but not installed.Installed Count \u2013 The number of updates that are applicable and are installed.Failed Count \u2013 The number of updates that attempted installation but failed.Not Applicable Count \u2013 The number of updates that are not applicable. Installed/Not Applicable Percentage \u2013 Displays the percentage of updates that are installed out of those marked as applicable. Needed Count \u2013 The number of updates that are required but not installed. Installed Count \u2013 The number of updates that are applicable and are installed. Failed Count \u2013 The number of updates that attempted installation but failed. Not Applicable Count \u2013 The number of updates that are not applicable. When reviewing these columns, you may notice that in some cases, the Installed/Not Applicable (%) column exceeds 100%. This anomaly can cause confusion regarding update compliance and is typically the result of WSUS miscalculating the percentage based on update applicability rules. You might expect that the Installed/Not Applicable Percentage value for each computer is calculated the following way:- Installed + Not Applicable / (Installed + Needed + Not Applicable) * 100 In this example, for computer cm2.lab2.local, that would be 5 + 159 / (5 + 2 + 159) * 100 = 99%But instead of 99% it indicates the Installed/Not Applicable percentage is 110% The reason this occurs is because the Not Applicable count data is not summarised correctly for some computers. Cause We can see the summarization data that causes the anomoly by viewing data in thetbComputerSummaryForMicrosoftUpdatestable. A negative value in the unknown column is still counted and contributes to the Not Applicable count. Executing the Stored Proceduredbo.spGetSummariesPerComputerindicates this further. Specifically, data that has aSummarizationStateof zero. dbo.spGetSummariesPerComputeris actually called to display the summary data in the WSUS console. You can see this if you run SQL Profiler and refresh the view in the WSUS console. Here is an example of an XML passed to the Stored Procedure The Stored Procedure creates various temporary tables and filters updates incorrectly based on Summarization States \u2013 which is the cause for the miscalculations outlined in this KB. Summarization inconsistencies can occur when clients report on update states for updates that have been declined/deleted since their last scan/report time. Resolution WSUS includes another Stored Procedure that can reset the summary data in this scenario.spResetOnlineSummaryTablescalculates update status summaries across all computers by counting updates by state (Unknown, NotInstalled, Downloaded, Installed, Failed, InstalledPendingReboot). To execute this Stored Procedure using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):- Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Connect to your SQL Server instance Enter your server name and authentication details Click \u201cConnect\u201d Navigate to the stored procedure in Object Explorer Expand \u201cDatabases\u201d Expand \u201cSUSDB\u201d Expand \u201cProgrammability\u201d Expand \u201cStored Procedures\u201d Finddbo.spResetOnlineSummaryTablesin the list Right-click ondbo.spResetOnlineSummaryTables Select \u201cExecute Stored Procedure\u201d Click \u201cOK\u201d The summarization of the data should now reflect accuratly in the WSUS console. Below is aBefore (1)andAfter (2)when running the Stored Procedure. In this example, 17 counts have been removed from some rows which now results in an accurate compliance calcualtion. Note:Deleting individual computers from the WSUS console will also fix the problem on a per-computer basis. When the computer reports back in, the compliance will be accurately reflected in the Installed / Not Applicable column.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-rollback-uninstall-third-party-update-in-configmgr/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to Rollback or Uninstall Third-Party Software Updates in ConfigMgr This article describes how torollback/uninstall a third-party software update in Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr). We get asked:how do I rollback a third-party update if there are issues in my environment. This guide will describe your options and some limitations that exist. No Native Support to Rolling Back Any Updates in ConfigMgr (Including Windows Updates) It\u2019s important to understand that thesoftware update featurein Configuration Manager doesn\u2019t natively support the uninstall/rollback of any updates, including Microsoft updates. If you needed to uninstall a Microsoft update, you would need to create a task sequence or package that runs thewusa.exeuninstall command manually. An example of this process is available atUninstall Windows Update Using SCCM. How to Rollback a Third-Party Update to a Previous Version in ConfigMgr To rollback a third-party software update, you can use theapplication management featureavailable in Patch My PC. You can useapplication supersedencein ConfigMgr torevert an application to a previous version. In the example below, we will show how torevert Google Chrome 87.0.4280.66 (x64)toGoogle Chrome 84.0.4147.105 (x64). To perform a rollback, you will need to have an application you want to rollback to as well as the version you want to revert from (the software update that was installed). Note:If you are using theUpdate existing application\u2019s metadata, deployment type, detection method, and content files (Default), you can enable theretain up to X previously created applicationsin theConfigMgr application optionsto provide you with a rollback option. Otherwise, previous application versions would not be available from Patch My PC. To revert to an older version, go to thepropertiesof the application you want to revert to and perform the following actions: Click theSupersedencetab > clickAdd\u2026> ClickBrowse\u2026 > Select thelatest applicationyour want to uninstall > Select the deployment type in theNew Deployment Typedrop-down > and Check theUninstallcheckbox. You can nowdeploy the applicationyou want to revert to, and the deployment will automatically uninstall the latest update before the rollback. Note:These rollback instructions apply to arequireddeployment. It is not recommended to apply these steps to anavailablerollback deployment. All the Patch My PC detection methods check for software versions greater than or equal to the desired version. Theoldapplication will return detected when thenewversion is installed. This can cause supersedence relationships to be unexpectedly evaluated during an available deployment. Perform an Uninstall of a Third-Party Application in ConfigMgr If you want to remove a third-partyapplication entirely, you can use theuninstall featureof theapplication management feature. Almost all applications created by Patch My PC will have the uninstall program defined in the applicationsdeployment type. You can deploy the application you want to remove as anuninstall deploymentto remove it from a device collection.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/path-denied-sccm/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Access to the Path Is Denied \u2013 Configuring Content Source Permissions In this article, we will cover the necessarypermissions required for the Patch My PC Publisher to manage contentfor the Applications which are published to Configuration Manager. This article is useful when you arereceiving errors such as the belowfrom the Patch My PC Publisher. Step 1: IdentifyWhoTo Grant Permissions To ThePatchMyPCServiceis the identity that will perform all content-based actions. This, by default, will run as theLocal Systemon the machine which runs the Publisher. This is generally your top-level Software Update Point, which may, or may not also be your primary site server. In our example,thewhowill be ourConfiguration Manager Site Server, namedSCCM. In other environments, this may be the site server or the software update point. Whichever is hosting thepublisher. If you have navigated the Base Install options, you might be familiar with an option to configure theSMS Provider connection. It is important to note the credentials in the below location arespecifically for interactions between the Publisher, and the SMS Provider, i.e. application publishing, content distribution, etc. For more details, seethis article.Otherwise,all of the file-based operations for managing the sources will happen as the Local System, as shown in the Services screenshot above. Step 2: IdentifyWhatTo Grant Permissions To The sources location which the service will need permissions to can be found within the settings of the Publisher. See below for the location of this setting. Note:You do not need to share out the direct folder which the settings reference. It just needs to be a folder that sits within a shared folder. For example, the share can be \u201c\\\\sccm\\sources\u201d while your source folder below can be \u201csccm\\sourcesPatchMyPC\u201d if you prefer. For our example, the share happens to be the same folder as the sources. Step 3: Configure the Permissions \u2013 Both Share, and NTFS The effective permissions of your sources folder will be the result of combining both your NTFS, and your Share permissions with the more restrictive being the effective permission. To simplify the management of permissions, the Share permissions are typically set to \u2018Everyone Full Control\u2019 as shown below. Don\u2019t worry, the effective permissions will be restricted by your NTFS permissions. As noted above, the share which you grant permissions on may not be the exact path specified in the settings. But the sources folder should be a subfolder of the share. With share permissions set, we can configure the NTFS permissions. This is where thewho,and thewherecomes into play, which we determined earlier to be the computer account which runs the Publisher, and the UNC path configured in the Publishing Tool. At a minimum, the computer account needs read, write, and modify permissions on the folder structure which will host the source content. This should also propagate to all subfolders and files. Because this is more restrictive than the \u2018Everyone Full Control\u2019 permission set on the share, this will be our effective permission for the SCCM principal. Other Considerations: Processes Locking Source Content Sometimes an \u2018Access Denied\u2019 does not mean the permissions are setup incorrectly. Instead, there can be a separate process that is locking the files. The typical culprits in this scenario are outlined below. Content distribution actively updating your content libraryProblem:Configuration Manager will take a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the source directory in order to determine what needs copied into the content library. This can cause a file lock.Solution:Wait for content distribution to complete, and attempt another synchronization Problem:Configuration Manager will take a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the source directory in order to determine what needs copied into the content library.

These two scenarios are a result of the sameroot causewhich is discussed below. Root Cause of Error 0x80070194 and 0X87D20417 These errors generally occur when the third-party update (.CAB) fie published to theWSUSContent folderis deleted, or the Content virtual directory in IIS is not configured properly. There are various reasons the update (.CAB) file for the published update(s) may not exist in the WSUSContent folder, including: CustomWSUS cleanup scripts removing contentfrom the WSUSContent directory The WSUSContent folder ismisconfigured in IIS The WSUSContent folder is pointing to aUNC network shareand the appropriate configurations and permissions weren\u2019t configured TheDeployment Package source pathdoes not have the neededNTFS or SMB permissionsconfigured Scenario 1: Automatic Deployment Rule Fails with Error 0X87D20417 or 0x80070194 Depending on the Configuration Manager build, you will see an ADR failure code of0X87D20417or0x80070194. Example of ADR withLast Error Codeof0x80070194 Example of ADR withLast Error Codeof0X87D20417 InPatchDownloader.log (For ADR), you will likely seeone of the following errorsin the log: HttpSendRequest failed HTTP_STATUS_NOT_FOUNDorHttpSendRequest failed 502 ERROR: DownloadContentFiles() failed with hr=0x80070194orERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x800701f6 Failed to create directory hostnamefolder.1_1.cab, error 5 CreateLinkToExistingFile() failed for ContentID . hRes = 0x80070005 ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x80070005 Inruleengine.log,you may also see one of the following errors in the log: Failed to download the update content with ID from internet.

HttpSendRequest failed HTTP_STATUS_NOT_FOUND ERROR: DownloadContentFiles() failed with hr=0x80070194 Error0x80070194translates to \u201cThe cloud file provider exited unexpectedly.\u201c Troubleshooting Step 1: Does the (.CAB Update Files) Exist in the WSUSContent Folder The first step you need to do is confirm the updates being downloaded exist in theWSUSContent folder. Here\u2019s a diagram that should help understand the data flow for the download of third-party updates. Determine the fulldownload URLbased on thePatchDownloader.log. Once the download URL is determined, you can check if thefolderandCAB fileactually exist in theWSUSContentfolder. Note:To match a missing .cab file to an Update in ConfigMgr or WSUS, please review the following articlehttps://patchmypc.com/associating-missing-cab-file-in-wsus-to-an-update If theCAB file doesn\u2019t exist, you will be unable to download and deploy that specific update(s) where the CAB file is deleted. Thepossible resolutionsfor this scenario are: Republish the update(s) as a new update and supersede the existing update Restore the CAB file is there is a backup of the WSUSContent folder that contains the CAB file If thetwo-character foldersin theWSUSContentfolder are deleted, we found the most common reason for this is when a deployment package in ConfigMgr uses the same path of the WSUSContent. This configuration will cause ConfigMgr to delete all folders, including published third-party updates periodically. Please review our articleIncorrectly configured deployment package to use the WSUSContent folder. If only theupdates (.CAB files) are missingfrom thetwo-character sub-foldersinWSUSContentand using a shared WSUS database with multiple WSUS servers, it may be a common certificate misconfiguration causing the .CAB deletion. Please reviewUpdate CAB Files Deleted from WSUSContent when Using Shared SUSDBif (.CAB) update files are automatically deleted right after publishing. Troubleshooting Step 2: Check if the WSUS Signing Certificate is Trusted on Site Server Another common reason ADRs may fail is theWSUS signing certificatehasn\u2019t properly been install on thesite server. If you have this issue, you will see the following errors. If failing to download when using ADRs, you should check thePatchDownloader.log (For ADR).You will likely see the following errors: Authentication of file C:\\UsersAppData\\Local\\TempCAB85AE.tmp failed, error 0x800b0004 ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x80073633 If failing to download when using ADRs, you theRuleEngine.logwill likely see the following error: Failed to download the update content with ID 16777699 from internet. Error = 13875 0x800b0004 = The subject is not trusted for the specified action.0x80073633 = Invalid certificate signature13875 = Invalid certificate signature To check if the WSUS signing certificate is installed, perform thefollowing actions: 1. Downloadthe specific update CAB file failing to download using a web browser or copy directly from the WSUSContent folder. You can get the update download URL or folder/file path to the WSUSContent folder based on thePatchDownloader.log 2.Copythe .CAB file to the machine running theConfigMgr console if failing to download via consoleor to thesite server if using an ADR. Onpropertiesof the file, review theCertification Pathtab, and review if there are any trust errors. If the certificate shows anytrust errors, you will need todeploy this certificate to all machinesormanually installit toTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherson the affected machine if for testing only. Troubleshooting Step 3: Verify the Content Virtual Directory is Correct If you validated theCAB file existed in step 1, the next step is to validate theContent virtual directoryin theWSUS Administrationwebsite is correct. There is a bug in the WSUS setup process that can remove the leadingwhen using aUNC pathfor the WSUSContent folder. To check thePhysical Pathfor the Content virtual directory:Right-click Content>Manage Virtual Directory>Advanced Settings\u2026 Here\u2019s an example of the WSUS bug where the leadingare removed from the virtual directoryPhysical Path. Because the directory is invalid in the Content virtual directory updates will fail to download with error0x80070194or0X87D20417. If you are affected by this scenario, simply update the path to include the leadingas shown below and clickOK Troubleshooting Step 4: Is WSUSContent a UNC Share with the Default IUSR Authentication We also see customers where aUNC pathis being used, and the authentication identity hasn\u2019t been changed to use theApplication pool identityfor theContent virtual directory. Perform the following actions to review and resolve this issue if applicable: ClicktheContent virtual directory> Double ClickAuthenticationin theIIS Group Right-ClicktheAnonymous Authenticationand ClickEdit Here you can review theAnonymous user identityused for authenticating to the WSUSContent directory. By default, the authentication is set to use the specific user:IUSR. IUSR is a local user-specific to the WSUS server and will not have access to a authenticate to anyremote UNC share. In theEdit Anonymous Authentication Credentialsdialog for theAnonymous Authenticationensure it is set to use theApplication pool identity Note:This step would only be applicable if the WSUSContent folder uses aUNC pathfor thePhysical Pathin theContent virtual directory. Troubleshooting Step 5: ADR\u2019s may Fail for Third-Party Updates if a Proxy is Enabled If all theprevious settings are correct, another common reason ADR\u2019s will fail to download third-party updates is due to aproxy being enabled. First, review if the checkboxUse a proxy server when downloading content by using automatic deployment rulesis enabled in theSoftware update point Properties A proxy of often required todownload Microsoft updatesdirectly from the internet for ADRs. However, in some scenarios where thePatchDownloader componentwill use the proxyfor the downloads from the internal WSUS server. If theproxy server cannot resolve the internal WSUS server using DNSor afirewall blocking the proxy from downloading content from internal servers, it will cause third-party updates to fail to download. InPatchDownloader.log (For ADR), you will probably see ahttps error 502. Here\u2019s an example of what you may see inPatchDownloader.logif theproxy server can\u2019t resolve the WSUS server name. HttpSendRequest failed 502ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x800701f6 In the image below, you can see details in thePatchDownload.logthatshows a proxy in use duringthe download of the software update. If you are affected by the proxy issue, we have a knowledge base article with workarounds atUpdates Fail to Download in ADR with Error HttpSendRequest failed 502 / 0x800701f6. Note:The specific HTTP error code can vary depending on how the proxy returns the download error, but the most common we have seen is502 errors. Troubleshooting Step 6: Is a Deployment Package Using the WSUSContent Folder? One issue that can cause files and folders to be deleted from theWSUS Content folderis when asoftware update deployment packageis using the WSUS Content folder as thepackage source location. Here\u2019s an example of a deployment package incorrectly using theWSUS Content folder(s)as the package source path. When a deployment package is configured to use the WSUS Content folder as the package source,Configuration Manager will automatically delete all files and foldersnot related to the deployment package, including thepublished third-party update CAB files. You can quickly check if any deployment packages are using the WSUS Content folder by performing the steps below: In the ConfigMgr console, navigate toSoftware Library>Software Updates>Deployment Packages Right-clickthe columns and addPkg Source Path In thesearch box, enter the wordwsusand click thesearch button. In our example below, we can see two deployment packages using the WSUS content folder(s) as thepackage source path. Your deployment package source path for Patch My PC updates should be a newdedicated folderthat isn\u2019t pointing to the WSUS Content folders at all. Here\u2019s an example of avalid pathandinvalid paths. If you had the WSUS Content pointing to the WSUS Content folders and theupdate CAB files where deleted, the workaround is therepublish the third-party updates affected. Please see the following knowledge base article:When and How to Republish Patch My PC Third-Party Updates Troubleshooting Step 7: Verify SMB and NTFS Permissions on Deployment Package Source Path This troubleshooting step mostly pertains to when you see \u201caccess denied\u201d type error messages or codes inPatchDownloader.logorruleengine.log, while also seeing the error code0X87D20417for your ADR in the SCCM console. The error codes you will likely see in the mentioned log files can be5or0x80070005. This particular issue revolves around trying to initiate the download for updates in to a Deployment Package. The likely root cause in this scenario is going to be insufficient permissions on the Deployment Package\u2019s source path. For ADRs to download updates to a Deployment Package, the SYSTEM account of the site server needs to be able to read and write to the source path. The solution is toreview the SMB and NTFS permissionsof the source path used for the Deployment Package. We have a seperate KB article dedicated to this topic:Failed to download content id . Error: Access is Denied. Troubleshooting Step 8: Recreate Automatic Deployment Rule and select \u201cDownload software updates from the Internet\u201d This troubleshooting step mostly pertains to when you see Failed to download the update content with ID XXXXXX from UNC content source. Error = 3 inruleengine.log, while also seeing the error code0X87D20417for your ADR in the SCCM console. This particular issue occurs when you select \u201cDownload software updates from a location on my network\u201d during Automatic Deployment Rule creation. The solution is to recreate the Automatic Deployment Rule and select \u201cDownload Software updates from the internet\u201d on the Download location section.

If the certificate is not installed within theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store, you will receive error code0x800b0109when attempting to install third-party software updates on devices. Here\u2019s thelist of optionscovered in the article fordeploying the WSUS Signing Certificateto devices: Use the Configuration Manager 1806+ Certificate Management FeatureValidate Client Setting Priority is Correct Validate Client Setting Priority is Correct Use Group Policy to Deploy the WSUS Signing Certificate Using a Configuration Manager Task Sequence During Imaging Use a Configuration Manager Configuration Item Option 1: Use the Configuration Manager 1806+ Certificate Management Feature If your Configuration Manager site and clients are running current branch 1806 or newer, the easiest option is to enable the new built-in option within the software update point forConfiguration Manager manages the updates. To enable this option,perform the steps below: In the Configuration Manager console, go to theAdministrationworkspace. ExpandSite Configuration, and select theSitesnode. Select the top-level site in the hierarchy. In the ribbon, clickConfigure Site Components, and selectSoftware Update Point. Switch to theThird-Party Updatestab. Select the optionConfiguration Manager manages the certificate. A new certificate of typeThird-party WSUS Signingwill be created in theCertificatesnode under theSecuritynode in theAdministrationworkspace. After performing the steps above,validate the certificate is created/imported: Trigger asoftware update point synchronizationby right-clicking the All Software Updates node, and clickingSynchronize Software Updates. If you review thewsyncmgr.log, you should see some details about the certificate being imported and created. If the certificate was configured successfully, if you re-open theThird Party Updates tab, you should see thecertificate details. Lastly, you need to enable the client settings toenable third party updates on clients: In the Configuration Manager console, go to theAdministrationworkspace and select theClient Settingsnode. Select the default client settings, an existing custom client setting, or create a new one. Select theSoftware Updatestab on the left-hand side. If you don\u2019t have this tab, make sure that theSoftware Updatesbox is enabled. Set theEnable third-party software updatestoYes. Validate the client settings isdeployed to all devices You can also review thestep-by-step video guidefor deploying the WSUS certificateusing Configuration Managerbelow: If your software update point isremotefrom yourtop-level site serverand the software update point isnot configured for SSL, the option within Configuration Manager toAutomatically manage the WSUS signing certificatewill not work and you will receive an error in wsyncmgr.logRemote WSUS connection is not HTTPS. This prevents software update point from getting the signing certificate for third-party updates. For more details about this scenario, please see the following Microsoft DocAdditional requirements when the SUP is remote from the top-level site server. Option 1.1: Validate Client Setting Priority is Correct If you enabled the client setting toenable third party software updates, performed amachine policy syncandsoftware update deployment evaluation cycle,and the client still didn\u2019t install the WSUS signing certificate, please perform the following check. View theresult client settingson the specific device, not installing the certificate from the ConfigMgr console\u2019sDevicesnode. If theresult client settingsshows the Enable third party software updates asNo, that means there another client setting taking priority of the policy you deployed to set this value to Yes. You can view all the client settings deployed to a specific device in theClient Settingstab. When troubleshooting client certificate installation issues, in addition to the client settings priority, you need to ensure theclient versionis alsoConfigMgr 1806ornewer. The client version for build 1806 is5.00.8692.1003 Important: By default, theEnable third party software updatessetting is configured toNofor any existing policies. This often causes machines where the policy is deployed to be overwritten by other client settings deployed to the same device. When you have multiple custom client settings, they are applied according to their order number. If there are any conflicts, the setting that has thelowest order number overrides the other settings. To change the order number, on theHometab, in theClient Settingsgroup, chooseMove Item UporMove Item Down. (Microsoft Docs) Option 2: Use Group Policy to Deploy the WSUS Signing Certificate You can also usegroup policy to deploy the WSUS Signing Certificateto devices within your environment. This option is helpful if you can\u2019t manage the certificateusing the Configuration Manager built-in option.

See the following two articles as examples on how to leverage scripts or additional files: How to customize your TeamViewer App or Update Advanced Application Configuration using Pre/Post Scripts Pass Variables into Pre and Post Scripts Available At:Products Applicable To:Applications, Software Updates Note:To include quotes in the arguments field for any of your pre/post scripts, wrap them indouble quotesescaped with abackslash. For example: Note:The pre/post scripts will be executed in whatever context the installation starts in.If an install/update will start in the SYSTEM context, so will the pre/post scripts. For user-based apps, the scripts will run in the USER context. Note:When specifying aPowerShell.ps1 script filefor either a pre or post-update script, and you attempt to pass anargument which accepts an array, you cannot use traditional PowerShell syntax. It helps to understand thatpowershell.exe is invoked from cmd.exeand therefore the syntax of-MyParameter \"Item1\",\"Item2\",\"Item3\"will not parse as you might intend when used in theArgumentfield. This is becausecmd.exe cannot interpert PowerShell arrays, it attempts to parse the second item in the array as a command or parameter. To workaround this, you could pass a string to your parameter with a delimiter and within your script split the string on the delimiter.

The default setting is to pop the toast notification is15 minutesbefore the reboot is enforced. Filter Mode and Filter Name This feature requires the Enterprise Plus subscription. Available At: All Products Applicable To: Intune Updates Note:To Assign and manage filters you will require anEnterprise PlusorEnterprise Premiumlicense. If an assignment in Intune has filters applied to it, these will be copied across to new product versions regardless of license level. Clicking onFilter Modewill cycle through the available modes \u2013Include,Exclude & None. Clicking on theFilter Namewill bring up a filter selection window to allow you to select which filter to apply to the assignment. Note:To assign and manage filters you will need to update your AAD application registration with theDeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.Allapplication scoped API permission. Note:Only one filter can be applied at one time to an assignment. Note:Setting the filter mode toNonewill clear the filter association from the assignment. When this checkbox is checked for a product the Publisher willenforce theintent (required, available, uninstall), mode, notification, and restart grace periodconfiguration for the assignments. If this checkbox is checked and an assignment targeting a specific groupchanges intent(i.e. required to available) ormode(i.e. include to exclude) then the assignment will bedeleted and recreatedduring the next sync. This would include a new available and deadline time based on your configured settings, as it is a newly created assignment. If this checkbox is checked and thenotificationorrestart grace periodconfiguration is changed in the Publisher the settings will be applied during the next sync. Note:Changes made in theManage Assignmentsright-click option arenot immediate.They are applied during the Publisher synchronization. Note:Some settings will not apply until a new application is published unless theOverridecheckbox is checked, or it is anewly created assignmentfor a group without an existing assignment.See the Override section above for more details. Note:The Publisher willnever delete an assignment directly. If you remove an assignment from the list, it will not be recreated in the future, but it will not be deleted. It may also be copied from previous app versions depending on yourIntune application creation options. Manage dynamic assignments This option allows you to publish application updates to Intune that will dynamically assign to security groups based on pre-defined search criteria. Read more about this option:Manage Dynamic Assignments This feature requires the Enterprise Plus subscription. Available At: All Products Applicable To: Intune Updates Manage categories This option allows you to set the categories that will be assigned to applications. The categories displayed will include existing categories. You can create new categories within this same UI using the + button to the right. Managing Intune categories: Managing SCCM categories: Note:Categories will beaddedto existing applications and updates during the next publisher sync, but theywill not be removedfor existing applications and updates. Whenever anewapplication or update is created the Publisher will ensure thecurrently specified categories are in place. Available At: All Products, Vendors, and Products Applicable To: ConfigMgr Apps, Intune Apps, Intune Updates Manage security scopes This option allows you to set the Security Scopes an application in ConfigMgr should be associated with. The Publisher will set the Security Scopes for the applications during the sync. The security scopes are pulled from your ConfigMgr environment. You can refresh the list with the button in the top right corner. Additionally, you can right-click the headers to add or remove columns. The list can be filtered by using the \u2018Filter items\u2019 textbox as well. Optionally, you can check the box toEnforce selected security scopes. When checked, the Publisher will ensure only the selected scopes exist on the ConfigMgr application. If a scope is added outside of the Publisher, such as directly in the ConfigMgr console, then the Publisher will remove the extra scopes during synchronization. Note:Security scopes will require new permission, specifically Application > Set Security Scope, and Security Scopes > Read, which you may not have in your Security Role created for Patch My PC. You can follow the instructions inthis articleto either re-import an updated role or set the new permissions manually. If you choose to re-import the role it will simply overwrite the permissions and retain your existing role assignments. Available At:All Products, Vendors, and Products Applicable To:ConfigMgr Apps Manage ESP Profiles This option allows you to manage theEnrollment Status Page profileswhich any Win32 application can be associated with (Intune Apps). The ESP are pulled from Microsoft Intune for your configured tenant. Note that the profile must have \u2018Show app and profile configuration progress\u2018 set to \u2018Yes\u2018 in order to appear in the list for selection. An example list is shown below. Also, this feature will require your Azure App Registration to haveDeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.Allpermissions set. Any Win32 application created by the publisher will be added to the ESP which are selected for the respective application. Old versions of Patch My PC-made Intune Win32 packages will be automatically removed, too, but only during the process of publishing/uploading the new Win32 package. In other words, the ESP association for the previous version of an Intune App will not be removed if you configure this after the fact, while the latest version is already in Intune. Available At: All Products, Vendors, and Products Applicable To: Intune Apps Manage Role Scope Tags This option allows you to manage therole scope tagswhich a Win32 application is associated with in Intune. The role scope tags are pulled from Microsoft Intune for your configured tenant. An example list is shown below.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/osd-install-fail-sccm/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Applications Fail in Task Sequence Error: AuthorizationManager check failed 0x87d00327 Since releasing our newapplication creation and management featurea few weeks back, we have noticed some customers opening cases with regards to trouble getting the applications to install during an operating system deploymenttask sequence. The most common reason applications may fail during a task sequence is the code-signing certificate isn\u2019t properly deployed ahead of theInstall Applicationstask sequence step. A Little Background \u2013 Our Applications and PowerShell Detection Method When our service creates applications in SCCM, we use a Powershell script for the detection method of the deployment type, as shown below. We also code-sign the Powershell detection method script by default using the WSUS Signing certificate. Determine if You are Affected When the device gets to theinstall application step, the device may fail to execute the detection method script if you are using a self-signed WSUS Signing certificate and the Powershell execution policy isnot ByPass. If the detection method script fails, it\u2019s because the WSUS Signing certificate used to code-sign it isn\u2019t trusted during the operating system deployment on the client-side. This trust failure is due to the fact that the device wouldn\u2019t have receivedgroup policyor theclient policyif you are deploying the certificateusing SCCMto add the certificate to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate stores. In the C:\\Windows\\CCM\\Logs\\AppDiscovery.log, you will also be able to see the failure when the SCCM agent tries to call the detection method script. It will contain lines similar to the image below. The Resolution \u2013 Install WSUS Signing Certificate as a Task Sequence Step Now that we see the cause, the resolution is pretty straight forward. You need to ensure the WSUS Signing Certificate you are using for third-party update publishing that is also used for signing the scripts is trusted before theinstall applicationstep in SCCM. The first thing to do isexport your WSUS Signing Certificatefrom the publishing service. In our example, we saved the file asWSUSSigningCertificate.cer Now that you have the certificate used for signing the detection method scripts, we need to import it on the client-side during the task sequence before the install applications step. Luckily this process is pretty easy, and we\u2019ll show you how. First, you can download our scriptImport-Certificates.cmdthat can be used for importing (.CER) files into theTrusted RootandTrusted Publishers. You will want to save theImport-Certificates.cmdfile in the same UNC folder as the exported (.CER) file. In our example, we used the folder path\\\\sccm\\sources\\Scripts\\Install-Certificates The batch script is very straight forward. It will importall(.CER) certificates that are in the same folder as the script to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store. The REG ADD commandon line 5 is optional, but it can be helpful if you want to also install third-party software updates using the Install Software Updates step in the same task sequence. Next, you need to create a legacy package in SCCM (No programs required if you only want to install the certificates via task sequence). If you\u2019re going to deploy this using software distribution to existing clients outside a task sequence, you can create a new program for the package the runsImport-Certificates.cmdas thecommand line. When creating the package, use the UNC path that you saved your(.CER) certificateto as well as theImport-Certificates.cmd. In our example, we used the path mentioned above. This package is used for accessing the content in the task sequence. Lastly, you need to add aRun Command Linestep before theInstall Applicationstep. Within this step, be sure to set the command line toImport-Certificates.cmdand enable thePackageoption and reference the package you created in the previous step. That\u2019s it!Now that the certificate chain is trusted before the Install Applications step, you shouldn\u2019t receive the trust error when the detection method script is executed. Note:This process can also resolve the error0x800b0109during theInstall Software Updatesstep of a task sequence because the default certificate deployment options such asgroup policyorConfigMgr client settingswon\u2019t apply until after the task sequence is completed.

To fix it, delete the app and all its retained versions from both disk and ConfigMgr, and let the Publisher recreate it cleanly \u2013 continue reading more guidance and context on the issue. This article will discuss how you can identify if you\u2019re impacted, provide remediation guidance, and also an optional technical deep dive reference on how the Publisher updates Configuration Manager applications. Determine if You Are Affected Customers experiencing this failure will likely have the following application update mode configured: \u201cUpdate existing application\u2019s metadata, deployment type, detection method, and content files (Default)\u201d (also known as an \u201cin-place update\u201d, where the existing application is updated without creating a new one) \u2013 and have a retention value configured. If affected, you will see the below notification: InPatchMyPC.log, the error will read along the lines of: The error message is presented whenthe Publisher has found the source path for the application about to be updated does not match the Deployment Type\u2019s source folderwithin Configuration Manager. If you\u2019ve encountered this error message, it\u2019s likely due to your source folders for the application(s) failing to update are in anunexpected state. Applications managed by the Publisher can enter this state through a variety of reasons. While the Publisher is updating an application and managing retention, a copy of its application content on disk is attempted, and we have seen customerantivirus solutions cause file locks and access denied exceptions during this process. In older versions of the Patch My PC Publisher, this scenario was not handled gracefully and subsequently caused nested Retained Apps folders with duplicate content, and duplicate applications within Configuration Manager. We have since implemented more robust error handling in these circumstances to ensure we gracefully handle these errors that are typically caused by antivirus solutions. Sinceversion 2.1.36.0of the Patch My PC Publisher,an improvement was added to ensure we do not process an application update when we detect it\u2019s in a state that might exacerbate the issueand create duplicate folders/applications Remediation To remediate the issue, the recommended approach is to delete the application producing the error and the entire folder structure for the product. If you continue to experience this error after performing this remediation once,open a technical support caseas we are committed to ensuring this scenario doesn\u2019t happen again and we can\u2019treproduce all scenarios that cause the failures. Ensure a Publisher Sync Is Not In Progress Identify the Product on Disk and Delete It Delete the Applications in Console for the Product 1. Ensure a Publisher Sync Is Not In Progress It is recommended toensure a sync is currently not in progress before continuing. You can do this by viewing PatchMyPC.log and monitoring its activity. Avoid performing clean-up while the Publisher is actively syncing. 2. Identify the Product on Disk and Delete It Here you will need to delete all content disk for the application(s) failing to update; the current version and all retained versions, too. The parent source folder is configurable in the Publisher under theConfigMgr Appstab ->Options. Generally, application source folders resemble the following pattern: Beneath the<Product>folder, you should seeone GUID folder(representing that version\u2019s update ID) and a \u201cRetained Apps\u201d folder (if there are any retained versions). In your environment, you may see multiple GUID folders beneath the<Product>folder and multiple \u201cRetained Apps\u201d folders that are nested within each other. This malformed folder structure is one of the core reasons contributing to the problem. For products likeGoogle Chrome (MSI-x64)you can expect its parent source folder to be: The name of the<Product>folder is the same name as the product you see in the Patch My PC Publisher. However, in scenarios where we rename products in our catalogue, the name of the folder will be the product\u2019s former name as you once saw it in the Publisher. For that reason, you may not find the application(s) source folder via browsing File Explorer if you were searching based on the product\u2019s name as you see it today in the Publisher. To locate the correct folder, use the Deployment Type\u2019s source path in Configuration Manager. For example, if an application\u2019s source path resembles the structure like any of the below, you shuold delete the folder\\\\server\\share\\Applications\\Google, Inc.\\Google Chrome (x64)and all its contents: The above example with Google Chrome is a real world example, where the product name was onceGoogle Chrome (x64)and renamed toGoogle Chrome (MSI-x64)in October 2024. 3. Delete the Applications in Console for the Product After you have taken care of all the application sources on the file system, the next task is simpler:delete the failed application objects within the Configuration Manager console\u2013 this includes the current versionand all old retained versions, too. Before you can delete these you may need to remove their deployments and any associations from task sequences or dependency relationships. Thereafter, you can initiate a sync of the Patch My PC Publisher and it willrecreate the application(s) with a clean, predictable folder structure. At this point, you should not have: More than one application for the same product within the Configuration Manager console More than one GUID folder within the product\u2019s parent source folder This remediation action should be a one-time measure. However, if you encounter this issue again, it is likely you have an environmental factor that is causing the issue and is not yet handled gracefully by the Publisher. If you encounter this issue again, kindlyopen a technical support case. How the Publisher Updates Applications This section is optionaland provides technical insight into how Patch My PC Publisher handles in-place updates for applications in Configuration Manager.It\u2019s not required readingto resolve the issue \u2013 butit may help understand the product\u2019s logic. Detecting Existing Application Versions When the Publisher begins synchronising ConfigMgr Apps, it checks to see if the version already exists by checking: File System Check WMI Check (SMS_Content) Both conditions for the above must find the application. If the application\u2019s source exists on disk but not in WMI, then the Publisher deletes the content on disk \u2013 this is to make way for publishing of the app again on the next sync. The Publisher first begins searches for the source folder on disk by performing an exact match. For example, if the update was forGoogle Chrome 137.0.7151.41 (x64)and its update ID was80fadc14-8188-41b9-b326-3f0735bbc470, it will first check to see if the below path exists: Note:If theSource Folderyou provided contains an FQDN address for the shared folder inConfigMgr Apps->Options, the FQDN will be stripped to just the hostname and replaced with a wildcard. For example,\\\\server.contoso.com\\sharewill be replaced with\\\\server*\\share. If it cannot find the folder with the exact the path above, it will then begin a wider search using wildcards: This use of wildcard is intended to provide flexibility when products are renamed. InPatchMyPC.log, if the new version does not exist and the current version needs updating: If the latest version already exists: TheSMS_Content WMI classprovides content information about Configuration Items (CIs) within Configuration Manager. Applications share the same base model as CIs within Configuration Manager. The Publisher performs a similar search routine in WMI as it does on disk, however with the exception for the usage of the wildcard \u2013 it uses a wildcard for both the vendor and product part of the folder. Each instance ofSMS_Contentcontains aContentSourcepath; the query to finding matching instances in this class would be similar to the below in the same Google Chrome example: An example PowerShell command that is equivalent would be as follows: This should return no more than two instances \u2013 one or two instances is acceptable. Application Update Flow (In-Place) Once it has been established whether or not the latest version of an application currently exists, the Publisher will begin publishing the new version if available. At a high-level overview, this process involves: Download the update to the cache content folder. If the download fails, abort publishing and move onto the next application. Note: By default this is C:\\Windows\\temp but it is customisable. Read more here:Customize Content Download and Log Save Location \u2013 Patch My PC PatchMyPC.log: Copy the source folder for the current version to a subfolder namedRetained Apps Note:It has historically been this step of publishing which has failed and largely caused the issues for customers, resulting in creating this knowledge base article. PatchMyPC.log: Clone the application within Configuration Manager for the current version. If this step fails, the Publisher deletes the folder from the previous step. PatchMyPC.log: Modify Package.xml within the source directory for the newly cloned app to contain the Package ID from the previous step If you have the option enabled toMove applications to the following folder in the applications node of the console, the newly cloned application will be moved to the designated folder PatchMyPC.log: If you have the option enabled toAutomatically distribute content for any newly created applications, the content for the newly cloned application will be distributed to the designated Distribution Point Groups PatchMyPC.log: Copy the binary downloaded in step 1 to the original application\u2019s source directory PatchMyPC.log: Rename the original application\u2019s source directory GUID to represent the latest update\u2019s update ID. This step is attempted five times with a 20 seconds pause in between each attempt \u2013 this is an attempt to combat antivirus solutions causing file locks or *access denied* exceptions Delete the old installer in the original application\u2019s source directory if it wasn\u2019t overwritten in step 7 Update the PowerShell detection script in the original application\u2019s Deployment Type to represent the latest version\u2019s detection logic PatchMyPC.log: Various attributes and metadata are updated on the application, e.g. the Software Centre tab If the optionDo not include the version in the application name, so the application name doesn\u2019t change after updates is not enabled, then rename the original application to represent latest version\u2019s title If you have the option enabled toAutomatically distribute content for any newly created applications, the content for the original application will be distributed to the designated Distribution Point Groups PatchMyPC.log: If there any old versions available for deletion as per your retention setting (Retain up to X previously created applications), delete those applications from Configuration Manager and their associated content within theRetained Appsfolder PatchMyPC.log: Notifications are sent via webhookwith the result, whether it be success or failure PatchMyPC.log: Free Trial Schedule Demo Schedule a Setup Call Schedule a Q&A Call ROI Calculator Advanced Insights Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC Publisher Home Updater CVE Insights PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) MEM Patching Optimizer About Us Careers Events & Webinars Customer Reviews Contact Us Call Us: 1 800 250 2334 FAQs Knowledge Base Catalog Release History Product Documentation Release Notes Partners & Resellers Feature Request Product Roadmap Patch Tuesday Blog Patch My PC Blog Support Forum Supported Products"}
{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/migrating-from-scup-patch-my/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Migrating from SCUP to Patch My PC Publisher System Center Updates Publisher(SCUP) In-console publishingwithin Microsoft Configuration Manager Patch My PC Publisher (on-premises publishing tool) Microsoft announced the end-of-life of System Center Updates Publisher (SCUP) in January 2024. Customers who subscribe to our Basic licence and use SCUP should now transition to an alternative, supported, publishing method. You can read more about the SCUP deprecation athttps://patchmypc.com/system-center-update-publisher-deprecated Important While we strongly encourage customers to transition to using our on-premises publishing tool \u2018Patch My PC Publisher\u2019, this does not need to be an \u2018either-or\u2019 migration in your early testing phase. You can test and use the new solution side-by-side with SCUP as you gain familiarity with the new tooling. As Microsoft are no longer supporting SCUP, we do recommend customers to migrate to Patch My PC Publisher by January 31st, 2025. We do not know if/when Microsoft might release a breaking change to the operating system that SCUP is installed on. What is Patch My PC Publisher? Patch My PC Publisher is a comprehensive tool, installed on a single Windows operating system, used for customizing and publishing third-party applications and updates to WSUS, Configuration Manager and Intune. Some advantages of using the Patch My PC Publisher over SCUP include:- The ability to create applications in both Configuration Manager and Intune (requires an Enterprise Plus subscription). Manycustomization options. Modern features such as supportingcustom apps(requires an Enterprise Plus subscription), webhook notifications and more. Automatically detect software based on Configuration Manager hardware inventory and keep applications up-to-date automatically. Email and Webhook notifications. Multiple options to synchronize the catalog. Integration withPatch My PC Cloud(requires an Enterprise Plus subscription). No agent required for client devices. Single console installation on the Software Update Point (SUP). Automatically update applications in a Task Sequence. Automatically clean-up un-needed WSUS content. Current limitations of the Publisher include:- Publisher cannot publish updates to a remote WSUS server. * Console access to modify and customize updates is only possible from the Software Update Point where the Publisher tooling is installed (either directly or by using RDP). * While the Publisher cannot publish updates to a remote WSUS server, it is important to note that the Publisher can be installed on a remote Software Update Point (SUP). Feature Comparisons The following table highlights the feature differences between SCUP, In-Console Publishing method and Patch My PC Publisher:- Publisher Requirements There may be some additional requirements for the Publisher when you transition away from using SCUP, depending on your existing server specification. The Publisher installs on the top-level Software Update Point in your Configuration Manager hierarchy. The SUP must meet the following requirements:- Software Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022 Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) installed and configured. (This feature should already be installed and configured if you are currently using SCUP). Environment Internet connection. Therelevant domain namesfor Patch My PC have been added to your firewall\u2019s allow list. Install the Publisher on the top-level WSUS/SUP server in the hierarchy. The Patch My PC Publisher will require the user launching the Publisher tool to be a local administrator on the server. Configuration Manager Console installed (Only required to communicate with the SMS Provider to initiate the SUP sync and create Configuration Manager application). Hardware CPU: 2 CPU or more. Memory: 8GB of RAM or more. Disk Space: 80GB of disk space or more. (The amount of disk space required will depend on the number of selected products). Migration Overview The transition from using SCUP to publishing third-party updates to Patch My PC Publisher is the recommended migration path for Patch My PC customers. Typically, customers would need a different license level which iscovered at the end of this article. For the most part, migration is relatively straight forward. There are a handful things to consider before migration, some of which are service affecting. Those items are covered in detail in the section below and in thevideoanddocumentationsections of this article. Migration Considerations Patch My PC engineers will help customers transition from SCUP to using the Patch My PC Publisher. Patch My PC will offer technical guidance over email or Teams and can assist with platform migration over a remote support session. The following items should be considered before transitioning from SCUP to Patch My PC Publisher:- Non Service-Affecting Considerations Existing updates from the Patch My PC catalog, published using SCUP, will not be removed from the WSUS or Configuration Manager database. If a newer version of an update is published using the Patch My PC Publisher, older updates already published to WSUS using SCUP will be superseded as normal/expected. API and URL endpoints remain unchanged. Existing WSUS SSL certificates do not need to be changed. Existing WSUS code-signing certificate does not need to be renewed ifeitherthe following conditions are met:-The private key of the certificate is marked as exportable.SCUP is already installed on the top-level SUP and the code-signing certificate is in the WSUS certificate store for the local computer. The private key of the certificate is marked as exportable. SCUP is already installed on the top-level SUP and the code-signing certificate is in the WSUS certificate store for the local computer. Service Affecting Considerations Any edits to the imported catalog to customize updates created by SCUP must be considered and manually added back when creating the updates using Patch My PC Publisher. Not all edits may be possible with the Publisher. Seehttps://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applicationsto understand what customizations can be applied to updates using the Publisher. If a previous version of an update was customized using SCUP, and Patch My PC Publisher performs a synchronization, those customizations will be overwritten. The update will be revised if the version synchronized by Patch My PC Publisher matches the existing version that was previously published using SCUP. Anycustomizationsmade to updates of the same version, that have already been published using SCUP, will require the updates to bere-publishedfrom the Publisher. This is because additional content is required for the update. Patch My PC Publisher must be installed on the top-level SUP. This might be a CAS in the hierarchy. Access to the CAS might be limited in some environments to configure the Patch My PC Publisher. If customers are unable to access the CAS, consideration should be given to moving to thein-console publishing methodinstead. Customizations to updates and/or applications applied using the Patch My PC Publisher will result in small Patch My PC \u201chelper\u201d binaries being packaged inside the update CAB file and/or application source folder. These binaries are used to customize the installation of third-party updates and applications. Environments that utilize whitelisting technologies such as Microsoft AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control might need to trust the Publisher of these helper binaries. Note: All Patch My PC helper binaries are signed by Patch My PC. Customers must choose whether they want to deploy meta-data only or full content when synchronizing updates using the Patch My PC Publisher. Unlike SCUP, there is not a threshold configuration that will automatically deploy content to WSUS for updates based on the number of devices that require the update in the customers environment. Migration \u2013 Video In this 25 minute long video we take a look at what is involved moving from SCUP to Patch My PC Publisher and discuss some of the features of the Publisher too. Note:Some features mentioned in this video, such as creating Configuration Manager applications, require theEnterprise Pluslicense subscription. Migration Documentation Detailed documentation for both SCUP and In-Console Publishing to Patch My PC Publisher migrations can be found atChanges-for-Publishing-Updates-to-Configuration-Manager-Using-Third-Party-Catalogs.docx Licensing Customers publishing updates using SCUP are typically subscribed to ourBasicsubscription. At the announcement of the deprecation of SCUP by Microsoft in January 2024, Patch My PC will no longer be renewing customers at this subscription level or offering it to new customers. The Basic subscription, used with SCUP, had many limitations, not least limited to:- It does not provide automated publishing of third-party software updates or applications. SCUP\u2019s configuration is saved, per-user, in %AppData%. It does not permit the creation of third party apps in Configuration Manager, only software updates. It does not permit the creation of third party apps or updates in Intune. Update customization is very limited using SCUP and customizations do not persist across new update version. SCUP does not support un-signed third-party binary installers. No new features. Customers will not be able to leverage any of the Patch My PC Right-Click customizations or new features such as Custom Apps.https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applicationshttps://docs.patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-cloud/custom-apps It is not possible to re-sign existing third-party updates in WSUS with SCUP. Reportiong: A noteworthy mentionThe Enterprise Patch subscription also includes outPatch Insightsreporting solution for software updates in Configuration Manager. Patch Insights offers a high-level overview dashboard, updates report, update groups report, update deployments statistics, OS upgrade report, and verbose computer status report. SubscriptionsThe current subscriptions offered by Patch My PC are:- Basic(no longer offered) Enterprise Patch Enterprise Plus Enterprise Premium The minimum subscription required when changing the publishing method highlighted in this document can be found in the table below:- * Customers may choose to migrate from using SCUP to theIn-Console method in Configuration Managerif publishing updates to a remote WSUS server is a hard requirement. This could be because access to the top-level SUP in the hierarchy is not accessible for the system admin responsible for patching. The in-console publishing method, while missing out on some of the great innovations that Publisher brings, is still a supported publishing method. In-Console publishing requires an Enterprise Patch subscription. Customers using the Basic subscription should have already been contacted by Patch My PC. If you have not, please reach out to[email protected]to speak with an Account Executive to understand how the deprecation of SCUP affects your current license subscription.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/uninstall-software-configmgr-intune/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to leverage Patch My PC to uninstall software from devices using ConfigMgr or Intune If you want to deploy Patch My PC Packaged software to uninstall it from managed devices, this article shows what you need to take into consideration. Introduction Sometimes, customers use Patch My PC Publisher to package software for deployment with uninstall intent. This means they want to remove software that shouldn\u2019t be on their corporate devices. While software packaged by our Publisher can be deployed with uninstall intent, there are some conditions for the uninstall to work effectively. What do I need to know? The uninstall feature for software published by Patch My PC only works if the version you\u2019re deploying, or a newer one, is already installed on the targeted device. If the device has an older version installed, the uninstall won\u2019t work. This limitation is because of the comparison operators used in our PowerShell detection scripts. To address this issue, follow the steps listed below, based on the platform you are using \u2013 either thePatch My PC OnPrem Publisheror thePatch My PC Cloud Portal. Patch My PC Publisher console If you are working with the OnPrem Patch My PC Publisher, you\u2019ll have to follow these steps: Select the Same Software: From theUpdatestab (for ConfigMgr) orIntuneUpdatestab (for Intune), choose the software you want to uninstall from your devices. Deploy the Update: Deploy the update to your devices to patch the software to the latest version. Deploy the App with Uninstall Intent: At the same time, select the software from theConfigMgrAppsorIntuneAppstab and deploy it with uninstall intent. Once the software is patched by the update on devices that have it installed, the uninstall of the app will be triggered, and the software will be removed. Even if users manually install the software again, this process will repeat itself as long as the deployments remain active. Patch My PC Cloud portal If you are publishing software from thePatch My PC cloud portal, you\u2019ll have to follow these steps: You will have todeploythe software from the portal. If you are not familiar with deployments from the Cloud portal, you can find more informationhere. Assign the deployment withUpdate onlyandUninstallintent and targed the group of devices / users you want to get the software uninstalled from. When the software is published to Intune, you will have two win32 apps. One of the will be the update \u2013 it will patch the software to the latest version on devices that have the software installed. The other one is the app, which will uninstall the software as soon as it\u2019s patched by the update mentioned above. If the assignments remain active, the process will be automatically repeated by Intune if the user manually installs the software again.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/republish-pmpc-apps/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Republish Patch My PC ConfigMgr Apps, Intune Apps and Intune Updates In this article, the topic of republishing non-WSUS updates in Patch My PC will be explained in detail. What is Republishing Republishing an app or update means that the selected app or update(s) content will berecreated in the assocated management system without changing the object ID. This means that the app or update will have any new right-click options applied as well as the most up-to-date applicability and detection scripts. Why Would an Update Need Republishing There are four scenarios that would require an update to be republished. Those scenarios, and the reason the republish is needed, are below. Aright-click optionis used thatadds content to an Intune app or Intune updateAdd custom pre/post update installation scriptsAdd MST transformation fileBranding/logo changed forManage conflicting processes\u2026Auto close application processes before installationSkip installation when the application is in useDelete desktop shortcut(s) created by this applicationDisable self-updaterManage installation loggingModify command line Add custom pre/post update installation scripts Add MST transformation file Branding/logo changed forManage conflicting processes\u2026 Auto close application processes before installation Skip installation when the application is in use Delete desktop shortcut(s) created by this application Disable self-updater Manage installation logging Modify command line Updated detection or applicability rules have been released by Patch My PCThis occasionally occurs when Patch My PC revises an update shortly after release, Patch My PC support may ask you to republish an app or update in this case This occasionally occurs when Patch My PC revises an update shortly after release, Patch My PC support may ask you to republish an app or update in this case The code-signing certificate has been updated. How to Republish Apps or Updates Once you determine what product(s) meet the criteria described above for requiring a republish operation you canright-click the product, vendor, or all products level and choose the\u2018Republish update(s) for these product(s) during next sync schedule\u2018 You may be prompted to verify if you want Patch My PC to Recreate Intune assignments for the products selected for republish. If you selectYes, you will be prompted to verify if you want tosupersede the currently published updatesfor this product when the new updates are republished. The popup also includes some details on how you can optionally expire those previously published updates. Note:If you select \u201cNo\u201d in the above prompt you willcontinue to receive warningsfrom the Publisher stating that the update could not be revised. To stop these warnings in this scenario you will want to decline the update which is failing to revise using themodify published updates wizard. The republishing of the selected updates will occur during the next publishing service sync. You can trigger this sync to happen right away by clicking theRun Publishing Service Syncin theSync Scheduletab. If you review thePatchMyPC.log,you should see the updates being republished. Republished updates will have the date appended to the update title here\u2019s an example:Google Chrome 84.0.4147.105 (x64) \u2013 (Republished on 2020-09-22 at 11:52) Optionally you can use theWSUS Optionsin theUpdatestab of the Publisher todisable the appending of the republish tag. See below for an example of the option. With the checkbox checked republished updateswill not have the republished tag, but would still supersede old updates if requested. Once the republishing has completed, the updates will show up in SCCM after the next software update point sync has occurred. You can force a sync to happen by clicking \u2018Synchronize Software Updates\u2018 in the Configuration Manager Console. You can monitor the SCCM software update point sync by reviewing thewsyncmgr.log. Once the sync is complete, you should see the newly republished update(s) in the console with the date appended as described above.

Determine if You are Affected If you are affected by this error, you will see the following error(s) in thePatchMyPC.logorSoftwareDistribution.log. An error occurred while publishing with timestamping, and timestamping is enforced: Failed to sign package; error was: 2148081670 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2148081670 PublishPackage(): Operation Failed with Error: Failed to sign package; error was: 2148081670 This error can occur if thecode signing certificateused for WSUShas been revokedby the Certificate Authority (CA). You can check if your certificate has been revoked by following these steps using the Patch My PC Publisher: ClickShow Certificatein theGeneraltab ClickValidate Trust Chain\u2026 Note:We have also had reports of this specific error from customers even when the certificate was not revoked. Therefore,all circumstances as to why WSUS uses this error code are not yet known. Solution If the certificate has been revoked by your CA,you may be able to unrevoke it. For example, if the certificate was issued by an Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) CA and the \u201cCertificate Hold\u201d reason code was used to revoke, then it is possible to unrevoke the certificate. If your certificate is not revoked and you still have the original .pfx for your current code signing certificate, you may want to first try re-importing that instead of issuing a new certificate. However, if re-importing the original code signing certificate does not solve the issue, then you will need toimport a new code signing certificate. You will need to do the following in order: Import your new code signing certificate Deploy your new code signing certificate to your devices Re-sign all of your existing third-party updates in WSUS Download all third-party updates into a new Deployment Package 1. Import your new code signing certificate For guidance to import a code signing certificate into the Patch My PC Publisher, seeWhat is the WSUS Signing Certificate and How to Create It. 2. Deploy your new code signing certificate to your devices For guidance to deploy your new code signing certificate, seeHow to Deploy the WSUS Signing Certificate for Third-Party Software Updates. 3. Re-sign all of your existing third-party updates in WSUS Using theModify Published Updates Wizard, select all of your existing third-party software updates in WSUS and choose the option toRe-Sign Update. 4. Download all third-party updates into a new Deployment Package At this point, after re-signing all of your third-party updates, all of the .cab files in the WSUS directory should have a digital signature. They will be signed with your new code signing certificate. You can verify this by browsing to your WSUSContent or UpdateServicesPackages folder and looking at the digital signature for any of your .cab files containing a third-party update. Now, you mustdelete any previously downloaded third-party software updates in any existing Deployment Packages. After you have done this, you need todownload all of your third-party software updatesinto anew Deployment Package in Configuration Manager. Updates need to be downloaded again because the .cab files in your current Deployment Package(s) are signed with your old code signing certificate. They need to be re-downloaded since their digital signatures have changed, and you need your clients to trust all of your third-party updates.

Determine if You are Affected The most common scenario that leads to us checking for duplicate Patch My PC categories is customers opening a support case mentioningnewly published updates aren\u2019t appearingin theAll Software Updatesnode in Configuration Manager. If you are affected by this issue, you should seemultiple Patch My PC categorieslisted in the Software Update Point properties. In the ConfigMgr console, navigate toAdministration>Site Configuration>Sites>Configure Site Components>Software Update Point. In theProductstab, check if there are multiple Patch My PC categories as shown below: Root Cause of Duplicate Product Categories The duplicate categories are caused by a change in WSUS on Server 2019, where it usesSHA2 instead of SHA1 to compute a unique category hash for a vendor category. Before Server 2019, WSUS would use SHA1 to compute a unique hash for a vendor category in the database. Unfortunately, this causes aduplicate categoryfor any updates published after a Server 2019 in-place upgrade. If you connect theSUSDBwith SQL Server Management Studio and run: execspGetTopLevelCategories You can see theduplicate categoriescreated Important:The duplicate category is not specific to Patch My PC updates. This WSUS bugaffects any published third-party category. For example, in the example below, you can see a duplicate Dell category when Dell drivers were published after the OS upgrade Resolution for Duplicate Patch My PC Categories The primary issue that causes customer problems is thenew company category in the Software Update Point Products tab has not been enabled. By not having it enabled, any newly published updates after the OS upgradedon\u2019t sync into ConfigMgr. The quickest and easiest fix is to simplyenable the second Patch My PC categoryin the Software Update Point Products tab Once the product is enabled and you completed asoftware update point syncin ConfigMgr, the new updates should appear in the All Software Updates as normal. Important:If you use an Automatic Deployment Rules that useVendororProductin the Software Update criteria, you will need to modify the search criteria. In theSoftware Updatetab of your automatic deployment rule, you will need to enable bothPatch My PC Vendors. Based on our experience, although it appears both Vendor categories may be enabled when clicking the Vendor that is not the case unless the ADR Vendor shows\u201cPatch My PC\u201d OR \u201cPatch My PC\u201din the search criteria. To enable both vendors, you canuncheckone of the Patch My PC vendors thenrecheckit again and the criteria should then listboth vendors.

Resolution: Set ADR Download Location to Download Software Updates From the Internet This error occurs because the ADR was initially configured to \u201cdownload software updates from a location on my network\u201d that does not contain the update it attempted to download, hence the \u201cThe system cannot find the path specified\u201d error description. A common mistake here is that the UNC path specified in the download location is set to a location intended to download the updatesto, such as a deployment package, when it is asking where to download updatesfrom. You do not need to designate a specific UNC path to download Patch My PC third-party updates. When setting up an ADR, you will need to configure the deployment package to \u201cDownload software updates from the Internet\u201d instead of a UNC path. The ADR download will automatically use the WSUSContent website where the update was published when the option \u201cDownload software updates from the Internet\u201d is checked. Unfortunately, this is not a setting you can change in the properties of an ADR after it is created.

What is \u201cAvailable Uninstall\u201d When creating or configuring a Win32 app, there is a setting to provide the uninstall option for the app for users in the Company Portal. When this setting is enabled, set to Yes, the Primary user of the device should see the option to uninstall the app. The Uninstall option will only appear if the app has already been evaluated as installed, using the detection method set on the Win32 app. Configure \u201cAvailable Uninstall\u201d in the Patch My PC Publisher You can enable the \u201cAvailable Uninstall\u201d option either at the Global level, where the setting will be applied to all Intune Apps or at the vendor/product level.

Clicking \u201cUninstall\u201d again will invoke a policy sync using the Company Portal Intune Management Extension Bridge. The app will be removed and the user will be presented with the following option to \u201cReinstall\u201d the app. This screen will also indicate if the uninstall was successful. Note:The \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button may not be visible, even if the \u2018Allow available uninstall\u2019 parameter has been configured if the device has never evaluated detection for the application currently deployed as \u2018Available\u2019. This can occur if an earlier version of the application deployed by Patch My PC was used to initially install the application and the device has subsequently installed an update. Applications and Updates from Patch My PC have different App Ids. If the uninstall option is expected for an application visible in the Company Portal but it is not available, simply click \u2018Install\u2019.

Timestamping can be helpful because even after the WSUS Signing Certificate\u2019s expiration date has occurred, clients will stilltrust any previously published updatesthat were signed with that certificate if it was timestamped. For example, the following WSUS Signing Certificate has an expiration date ofMay 20, 2023. If timestamping is enabled, clients will trust an be able to install updates even after the expiration date. We usually recommend leaving timestamping enabled, but if you need to disable the timestamp feature, you can create the following DWORD value: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Patch My PC Publishing Service:DisableTimestamping = 1 After creating the registry value, you will need torestart the PatchMyPCService One reason why you may want to disable time stamping is to test if updates may be failing to publish due totimestamping firewall rulesorproxy not configured at the system-level. Error Codes When Access to the Timestamping Server is Blocked or System-Level Proxy not Configured If a proxy is in use, we recommend reviewing our articleUpdate Publishing Fails When Proxy is in Use, and Timestamping is Enabled.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/troubleshooting-clients-unknown-update-state/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Troubleshooting Clients with Unknown Update State in Configuration Manager (SCCM) We have seen an increase of cases whereupdate statesmay show as Unknown for a large number of devices. Customers facing this issue will generally see third-party updates not applying when the updates areapplicable to the devices. AnUnknownupdate state means the device(s) haven\u2019t successfullyscanned against the WSUS serveror haven\u2019t been able toreport the scan results to the Configuration Manager site. There are a variety of possible causes that could cause scan issues. Please see the Microsoft docTroubleshoot software update scan failures in Configuration Manager \u2013 Compliance results unknown. Determine if You are Affected If you are affected by scan issues, you will likely see a high percentage of devices showing anUnknown statein the ConfigMgr console\u2019sAll Software Updatesnode. Although this issueisn\u2019t specific to Patch My PC, we will review some troubleshooting methods below as best-effort support. Note:Depending on your Windows Update for Business (WUfB) policies, it\u2019s possible Microsoft updates can still apply from WUfB even if results show unknown in the ConfigMgr console. Third-party updates will never be applied if the update is in anUnknown state. Please seeUsing ConfigMgr With Windows 10 WUfB Deferral Policiesfor more details about WUfB policies. Troubleshooting Step 1: Troubleshoot software update scan failures in Configuration Manager Microsoft has a detailed knowledge base articleTroubleshoot software update scan failures in ConfigurationManager. We recommend starting your troubleshooting using this KB article. This article covers the following possible issues for software update scans: Scan failures due to missing or corrupted components Scan failures due to proxy-related issues Scan failures related to HTTP time-out or authentication Determine the port settings used by WSUS and the software update point Determine the WSUS port settings in IIS 7.0 and later versions Verify and configure ports for the software update point Scan fails with error 0x80072f0c Group Policy overrides the correct WSUS configuration information Clients can\u2019t find the WSUS server location Compliance results unknown The following article describes log files the processes totroubleshoot client software update scanning. Troubleshooting Step 2: Review the Troubleshooting 1 \u2013 Scan errors Report In most cases, the Microsoft troubleshooting guide isstep 1will help you resolve the issue. We will also share some common issues andtroubleshooting methodswe have found helpful. The following reportSoftware Updates \u2013 E Troubleshooting>Troubleshooting 1 \u2013 Scan errorscan be run if you have thereporting services point installedin your ConfigMgr site. In this report, you can review if there are a large number of devices reporting scan errors. Troubleshooting Step 3: Can the Client Find the WSUS/SUP Server? Another common reason that can cause clients to show unknown is beingunable to locate a WSUS serverto scan against. Please see the Microsoft articleWSUS server locationto understand how clients receive the WSUS server to scan against. If the software update point isn\u2019t associated with a boundary group the clients are in, it will cause the clients to not scan against the WSUS server causingUnknown statesfor updates. For more details, please see the articleConfigure boundary groups for Configuration Manager. FromMicrosoft Docs:Clients useboundary groups to find a new software update point. To control which servers a client can find, add individual software update points to different boundary groups. If you add all existing software update points to the default site boundary group, the client selects a software update point from the pool of available servers. This behavior is similar to earlier versions of Configuration Manager current branch. For controlled selection and fallback behavior, add individual software update points to different boundary groups. If you install a new site,software update points aren\u2019t added to the default site boundary group. Assign software update points to a boundary groupso that clients can find and use them. Troubleshooting Step 4: Group Policy Conflict Causes Error 0x87d00692 One of the most common reasons we see for scan failures is aGPO conflict overwriting the WSUS serverConfigMgr is trying to set locally. If affect, In thescanagent.log, you will likely see the error: CScanJob::Execute- Failed at AddUpdateSource, Error = 0x87d00692 If you receive the error above, please review our KB articleUpdate Scan Error: Job error (0x87d00692) received for assignment ({ID}) action Troubleshooting Step 5: IIS Application Pool Running and Optimized WSUS ultimately relies onMicrosoft IISon the backend, even when integrated with Configuration Manager. If the IIS website or application pool are not working properly then client devices may have scan errors, or report an unknown scan status.Within IIS on the server running WSUS we can see the below server has both theWSUS Administrationand theWsusPoolin a stopped state.When this does happen, clients may exhibit various errors in theWUAHander.log, two of which are below. OnSearchComplete \u2013 Failed to end search job. Error = 0x80244022 OnSearchComplete \u2013 Failed to end search job. Error = 0x80240438 To begin with, the two should be started again. You can simply highlight the WSUS Administration website, or the WsusPool and selectStartfrom the Actions pane on the right hand side of IIS. Commonly theWSUSPool Application Pool will crash dueto a lack of resources, or the app pool needing some advanced configuration changes. Microsoft has some docsherewhich can help give a good baseline for your IIS configuration.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-use-patch-my-pc-in-a-disconnected-environment/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to Use Patch My PC in a Disconnected Environment without Internet We often get asked if Patch My PC supports publishing third-party updates to WSUS/SCCM in atotally offline environment with no internet access. Offline environments are a supported scenario, and luckily the process is similar to how you would export and import normalMicrosoft updates in a disconnected WSUS environment. Example Environment Setup In our example, we have the following WSUS servers: DEMO1= This WSUS server is independent on the offline environment and used to sync regular Microsoft updates DEMO2= A fully offline WSUS server used for client scanning in the disconnected environment. This server has no internet access. Note from Microsoft Docs:When the software update point at the top-level site isdisconnected from the Internet, you must use theexportandimportfunctions of theWSUSUtiltool to synchronize software updates metadata and content. You can choose an existing WSUS server not in your Configuration Manager hierarchy as the synchronization source. Step 1: Publish Updates from Internet-Connected WSUS Server Similar to how Microsoft updates need to be synced from astandalone internet-connected WSUS server, you will need to publish third-party updates to aninternet-connected WSUS server first. In this example, we haveinstalled and configuredthe Publisher software on DEMO1. We have published 7-Zip and Google Chrome to the WSUS on DEMO1. We also confirmed the updates have been published to WSUS using theModify Published Updateswizard from theAdvancedtab. Once updates are published to the online WSUS server, you can proceed to theexportstep. Step 2: Export the WSUS Catalog from the Online-WSUS Server After publishing updates to the online-WSUS server, you need toexportthe WSUS catalog that includes the metadata for those published updates. The exported file will then beimportedinto the WSUS server in the offline environment. Toperform the export update metadatafrom WSUS perform the following: Open acommand promptasadministrator In the command prompt window, change the directory to the WSUS tools directory. Generally, this will be:cd \u201cC:\\Program Files\\Update Services\\Tools\u201d Once there, run theWSUSUtil.exeexport command to export the catalog.wsusutil.exe exportpackagename logfileIn our example, we ran:WsusUtil.exe export \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.xml.gz\u201d \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.log\u201d wsusutil.exe exportpackagename logfile In our example, we ran:WsusUtil.exe export \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.xml.gz\u201d \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.log\u201d Step 3: Import the Exported File on the Offline WSUS Server Copy the.xml.gzfrom the online WSUS server to the offline WSUS server. On the offline WSUS server, perform the following steps to import the file: Open acommand promptasadministrator In the command prompt window, change the directory to the WSUS tools directory. Generally, this will be:cd \u201cC:\\Program Files\\Update Services\\Tools\u201d Once there, run theWSUSUtil.exeimportcommand to export the catalog.In our example, we ran:WsusUtil.exe import \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.xml.gz\u201d \u201cC:\\WSUS-Import-2020-09-02.log\u201d In our example, we ran:WsusUtil.exe import \u201cC:\\WSUS-Export-2020-09-02.xml.gz\u201d \u201cC:\\WSUS-Import-2020-09-02.log\u201d Optionally, after the import, you can run the modify published updates wizard on the offline WSUS server to verify the published third-party updates from the online-WSUS where imported: Step 4: Copy the WSUSContent and UpdateServicesPackages to the Offline WSUS Server Once the WSUS metadata has been exported and imported, the last step is to ensure the WSUS content folders arecopied to the offline environment. In our scenario, a local network connection exists betweenDEMO1andDEMO2, so we usedrobocopyto copy new content in the DEMO1 WSUS folder to DEMO2. The command in our example was:robocopy \u201cJ:\\WSUS\u201d \u201c\\\\demo2\\j$\\WSUS\u201d /E Important:If you do not copy the WSUSContent folder to the offline environment, third-party updates will be unable to download on clients or into a ConfigMgr deployment package. This is because the third-party updates are signed using yourWSUS signing certificateon the online-WSUS server.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/third-party-updates-fail-download/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Third-Party Updates Fail to Download in ConfigMgr 1910 if Download Delta Update Enabled \u2013 0x80d02002 Microsoft has docs that discuss this scenarioherein the \u2018Important\u2019 note box, specifically the last bullet point. We were able to reproduce this issue and wanted to explain what\u2019s happening and a workaround. Step 1: Check if Download Delta Content Client Setting is Enabled For our scenario, we could only reproduce the third-party software update download issue when the client setting \u201cAllow clients to download delta content when available\u201d within \u201cSoftware Updates\u201d is enabled. A quick way to check if this client policy may be enabled on a device facing the download issue is to right-click the device in theDevicesnode >Client Settings>Result Client Settings. In the Result Client Settings, check if the policy is Yes. Step 2: Reproduction of the Scenario In our scenario, we had an available software update group deployment whereGoogle Chrome 81.0.4044.113 (x64)UpdateID:ff665b30-ccef-4806-9f81-7b5a762063d5was targeted to a device. Since this was an available deployment, we started the update installation using software center, but a required deployment would have the same download errors. Once the download is triggered, we will see the following data inDataTransferService.log CDTSJob::HandleErrors: DTS Job \u2018{857B9A7B-0908-44AE-BB80-96F30EF11E96}\u2019 BITS Job \u2018{0B57534F-36B3-4BA9-A07E-850F1B5C0CE4}\u2019 under user \u2018S-1-5-18\u2019 OldErrorCount 0 NewErrorCount 1 ErrorCode 0x80072EE7 Failed to set proxy to bits job for url \u2018http://sccm:80/Content/EB/2ABF1D5BCD7564FD2DF0E8DC6CFB628E6DEA4FEB.cab\u2019. Error 0x87d00215 All proxy types and no proxy have been tried but failed. Loop the types again for the 1 time The first interesting thing we notice is the client attempts to download the content from the internal WSUS server, but this actually isn\u2019t our issue and is a known scenario please see ourUserVoice requestto improve this behavior. The download against the internal WSUS will usually timeout after 3 attempts and fall back to your CMG-based distribution point. The log that will help us see the issues in this scenario isDeltaDownload.log. In this log, we can see the following lines: Failed to send HTTP Response. Error=800704cd We will see this happen for each updateevery 3 minutesfor about30 minutesbefore the download will fail. Once the download times out, we will see the following error inWUAHandler.log. Unexpected HRESULT for downloading complete: 0x80d02002 Step 3: Root Cause and Workaround In build 1910, the setting todownload delta content filesis enabled by default. Delta update content is not applicable for third-party updates, and it seems to cause the download to fail completely. We were able to resolve this download issue by disabling the client settingsAllow clients to download delta content when available. Once the client received the policy and applied this change, it was able to download the third-party software update. You may still see the device attempt to download the content from the internal WSUSContent folder three times (3 minutes) before it falls back to your CMG distribution point for each third-party update.

If you perform an error lookup usingControl+Lin CMTace.exe, you will see the error description for0x87d00692= \u201cGroup policy conflict\u201c. Group policy conflict means aGPO has been configuredto set the WSUS server to a different server than the ConfigMgr software update point. A GPO will take precedence over the local GPO policy the ConfigMgr client is trying to set. To determine the GPO setting the WSUS server OpenMMC.exe,File>Add/Remove snap-in\u2026 > Add Resultant Set of Policy ClickGenerate RSoP Data\u2026 You can leave thedefault optionswhen clicking through the Generate RSoP data wizard. Once complete, navigate toComputer Configuration>Administrative Templates>Windows Components>Windows Update > Specify intranet Microsoft update service location How to Fix Error 0x87d00692 Remove or stop targetting the group policy that is setting the policySpecify intranet Microsoft update service location. Once the GPO is not applied to a client, the ConfigMgr client will set the correct software update point dynamically based on boundary groups and other site configurations. Please see theMicrosoft Doc describing this policy when using Configuration Manager When the software update point is created for a site, clients receive a machine policy that provides the software update point server name andconfigures the Specify intranet Microsoft update service location local policy on the computer. The WUA retrieves the server name that is specified in the Set the intranet update service for detecting updates setting, and then it connects to this server when it scans for software updates compliance. When a domain policy is created for the Specify intranet Microsoft update service location setting,it overrides the local policy, and the WUA might connect to a server other than the software update point. If this happens, the client might scan for software update compliance based on different products, classifications, and languages. Therefore, youshould not configure the Active Directory policyfor client computers. Note:Depending on other Windows Update GPO\u2019s and the timing of policies being removed and applied, clients mayscan against Windows Update directlyonce the GPO is disabled and before the new WSUS server policy is configured locally by the Configuration Manager client. Once the GPO is no longer applied to devices, you can optionally trigger aSoftware Update Deployment Evaluation Cycle. This cycle will trigger the client to attempt to set the local policy for the WSUS server to the Configuration Manager software update point. Note:You may want to limit the number of devices you perform this action on at once to avoid large WSUS scanning traffic. In the WUAHandler.log, you should see the WUA Manager server can now be set by the ConfigMgr client, and the GPO conflict error will go away.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-publishing-alerts-work-patch/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How Publishing Alerts Work in Patch My PC\u2019s Publisher An important factor of third-party patching isstaying informedas new updates publish in real-time. Our alerts feature allows you to be notified via the following methods: Email Microsoft Teams webhook notification Slack webhook notification This article will cover how theSMTP SettingsandWebhook Settingswork within ourPublisher. How do Email Alerts Work in the SMTP Settings? IMPORTANT: Patch My PC Publisher, at this time, cannot support Modern authentication and relies on SMTP authentication for sending email reports. Please refer tothisarticle for more information on how to re-enable SMTP authentication for 1 specific mailbox, which will allow Patch My PC Publisher to authenticate and send emails through your Exchange Online environment. TheSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)has been around since 1982 and is a common method for sending emails. OurPublisherallows you to configure SMTP settings to send email alerts forpublishing operations. The first step is to configure the required options for your SMTP server. Note:TheRecipientsandCC Recipientsvalue(s) must be a valid email address. You can specify multiple email-addresses and seperate the addresses with a semi-colon. e.g.[email protected];[email protected]. Once the settings are complete, you can click theTest buttonto see if the recipient received the test email. If you have any issues sending emails, it\u2019s likely anSMTP configuration error, and you can review our articleTroubleshooting SMTP Email Report Sending When Using Patch My PC. Once the SMTP settings are saved, the Publisher will automatically send an email at the end of each synchronization whenany updates or applicationshave been published. The email will include the following details for all Published products: Update/ApplicationTitle(Links to release notes) Timeof Publishing Sizeof binary UpdateClassification UpdateSeverity Level CVE\u2019s(Links to CVE-ID onhttps://cve.mitre.org/) In the example below, you can see an email alert where bothupdates and applicationswere published toWSUS & ConfigMgr. In the example below, you can see an email alert where bothUpdates and Applicationswere published toIntune For products published toIntune, The email will include the following additional information Intune Tenant friendly name Intune assignments set during Publishing. How do Alerts Work in Microsoft Teams and Slack? Another option for Alerts is to use aMicrosoft Teams Webhookor aSlack Webhook. The Teams or Slack webhook will allow the Publisher tosend a message into a Teams or Slack channeleither as each update or application is publishedin real-timeor a single message at the end of the synchronization. Note:Microsoft announced the end of support for traditional Office 365 Connectors. You can read more about this announcment and how it affects Patch My PC alerts athttps://patchmypc.com/migrating-from-office-365-connectors-to-the-workflows-app Customers are encouraged to migrate existing webhooks of theMSTeams\u201cMessage System\u201d type to theMSTeamsWorkflow\u201cMessage System\u201d type beforeDecember 2024.Migration of existing webhooks is covered below in the sectionHow to Update Existing Microsoft Teams Webhooks to Support Microsoft Teams Workflows. Note:TheMSTeamsWorkflow \u201cMessage System\u201d type is supported inPatch My PC Publisher version 2.1.27.0or higher. How to Create a Microsoft Teams Webhook URL Before you can send Microsoft Teams alerts, you need to create a Microsoft Teams Workflow to obtain a valid webhook URL. IMPORTANT The account being used to create the Teams Workflow must be a member of theTeam > Channelwhere you want the Patch My PC notifications to appear. The notification will include the name of the person who created the Teams Workflow. You cannot omit the name from the notification. This is by design from Microsoft. Please follow the steps below tocreate an incoming webhook URL: Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to the Channel where you want to receive Webhook Notifications. Click the More Options button\u2026and selectWorkflows. SelectPost to a channel when a webhook request is received. Allow a moment for the template to load, it can take a minute or two. ClickNext. Allow a moment for the details tab to load to verify which Team and Channel the webhook URL will be created for and clickAdd workflow. Click thecopy iconto copy the webhook URL to your clipboard and clickDone. In the Patch My PC Publisher, navigate to theAlertstab and in Webhook Settings clickAdd. Add aLabeland paste the Workflows URL obtained in Step 7 into theWebhook URLbox. Configure additional settings for the alert too. ClickOkto save the webhook and clickTestto ensure the newly configured webhook is received to the Microsoft Teams channel. Consideration for Private Channels In Microsoft Teams, bots, including those created via Power Automate (Flow), can interact with channels to provide automated responses, notifications, and other functions. However, posting messages as a Flow bot to a private channel presents a challenge because of permissions restrictions that exist within the Teams platform. A private channel in Teams is a more restricted environment compared to a standard channel. Only members who are specifically added to the private channel can access it and interact within it. To ensure the workflow can post to a private channel, you need to edit thePost Asvalue for the Flow. 1. Navigate tohttps://make.powerautonmate.com 2. Find the Workflow(s) used for Teams notifications in the Private Channel and clickEdit. 3. Select the step in the flow chart namedPost card in a chat or channel. 4. Modify thePost Asvalue and change it fromBottoUser. 5. ClickSave. How to update existing Microsoft Teams webhooks to support Microsoft Teams Workflows Microsoft announced that Office 365 connectors are being deprecated. You can read the full post athttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/ To prepare for this change, Patch My PC now supports the Microsoft Teams Workflows app which is Microsoft\u2019s recommended alternative to using Office 365 connectors to generate webhook URLs to receive notifications in Microsoft Teams. Workflows only support the \u201cAdaptive Message Card\u201d format. Legacy webhooks created in the Patch My PC Publisher use the \u201cMessage Card\u201d format. Note:Patch My PC Publisher version 2.1.27.0or higher is required to update legacy webhooks to support Microsoft Teams Workflows. Which webhooks should I update? Any webhook configured with theMSTeams\u201cMessage System\u201d(2)in the Publisher should be updated to theMSTeamsWorkflow\u201cMessage System\u201d(1)type. To update an existing webhook to the new format:- Follow the steps outlined inHow to Create a Microsoft Teams Webhook URLto generate a new webhook URL for a Microsoft Teams Workflow. Highlight the webhook and clickEdit. Change theWebhook ProviderfromMicrosoft Teams (Legacy Webhook)toMicrosoft Teams Workflow. Replace the existingWebhook URLwith the one obtained by completing Step 1 above. ClickOk IMPORTANT:The table formatting in the adaptive card for Teams may appear misaligned or incorrect unless thePost Asparameter in the flow action is set toFlow Bot. How to Create a Slack Webhook URL Before you can send Slack alerts, you need tocreate an incoming webhook: Please follow the steps below tocreate an incoming webhook URL: On the following web pagehttps://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks, selectCreate your Slack app(note: you will need to be logged into your Slack account and, depending on your settings, you may need to be a Workspace Owner of the account) SelectCreate an App > From Scratch.Enter an app name, choose your workspace, and then selectCreate App SetActivate Incoming WebhookstoOn SelectAdd New Webhook to Workspace Choose the channel you want to post to and then selectAllow Copy the Webhook URL andPastethe URL into the Webhook URL in the Publisher and click theTest button In the Patch My PC Publisher under theAlertstab, selectAddin theWebhook Settingssection In the Notification Webhook Configuration window, enter a Label for your webhook, setWebhook ProvidertoSlackandPastethe URL into theWebhook URLfield. ClickOKwhen done Click theTestbutton You should see thetest messagesent in the Slack channel you selected Custom Options for Teams and Slack Webhooks You can configure the webhook notifications for Teams or Slack in theNotification Webhook Configurationwindow. To view the Notification Webhook Configuration selectAddorEditunderWebhook Settings. When the option \u201cSend alerts as each product is published rather than waiting until the end of the synchronization.\u201d is enabled, the Publisher will send a messagein real-timeright after each update or application is published. When this option is enabled, the message will include more detailed information about each update, including: Update/ApplicationTitle(Links to release notes) Timeof Publishing Sizeof binary UpdateClassification UpdateSeverity Level CVE\u2019s(Links to CVE-ID onhttps://cve.mitre.org/) Below is an example of the individual notification in Teams. When the option \u201cSend alerts as each product is published rather than waiting until the end of the synchronization.\u201d isdisabled, the Publisher will only send a summary of updates and applications published at theend of the synchronization. This option willonly include the nameof the update or application and link to the release notes. Below is an example of the Teams summary notification. You can choose thenotification level in the Notification Webhook Configuration window. The levels include receivingAll,Error, orSuccess.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/intune-policy-limit-considerations/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Policy Size Limit Considerations In this article, we will discuss the existing limits on Intune Policy as it relates to Win32 application assignments. With these limits in mind, we can better plan the deployment of Intune Applications and Updates. Identify If You Are Hitting Policy Size Limit Reducing Policy Size Identify If You are Hitting Policy Size Limit For most of our customers, the policy size limit will not be an issue. The policy for the Win32 applications in Intune includes the PowerShell Detection and Requirement scripts for the application.The more applications you have assigned to any given device, the larger that policy will be. The most immediate affect of exceeding the policy limit isthe client will stop processing application policies from Intune. To quickly identify if you are running into policy size limits you can check the two logs below. %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs\\IntuneManagementExtension.log %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs\\IntuneManagementExtension.lo_ Within these logs, you can look for a line that starts with the below snippet. Failed to get the app policy from service, exception is System.ArgumentException: Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property\u2026 It is likely a large Base64 encoded JSON payload will be shown as well, such as below. Note:If you are hitting the policy limit the client will not be able to process application assignments. Reducing Policy Size There are a few options to consider when you need to reduce the total policy size your clients receive from Intune. Applications vs. Updates The largest part of any given Win32 application\u2019s policy is the scripts associated with it. For the Win32 Applications, this will be theDetection Script. For the Updates that the Publisher creates there will be aDetection Scriptand aRequirement Script. Because the Updates have two scripts they will inherently consume more space in the policy payload. Code Signing Within the Publisher the option to \u2018Digitally sign the detection method script\u2026\u2019 is provided as shown below. When a script is digitally signed it willadd approximately 10kb to the total script size. This does not seem like a lot, but for Intune Policy this is a very significant amount of overhead. Keeping in mind thatIntune Updates will have policy containing two scriptswhen these are signed the policy per-app increases by approximately 20kb. Note:In our testing, a device was able to have80-90 Intune Updates assignedwithout hitting the policy limit while having code signing enabled. With code signing disabled a device could haveover 300 applications assigned as Intune Updateswithout hitting the policy size limit. Number of Assignments With code signing, and the type of Win32 Application in mind the final consideration is the number of assignments.The larger the number of assignments to any given device the larger the policy will be for that device when it requests it from Intune. The business will need to determine their security requirements around code signing, and what applications they desire to update. The Publisher does have anIntune Scan Toolthat can assist in identifying products that exist on your Intune managed devices, but it does have limitations based on what is available via Microsoft Graph such as only MSI based applications being inventoried. Alongside identifying what software your devices have, you can leverage tools likeMicrosoft Defender Advanced Threat Protectionto identify known vulnerabilities and CVEs on your devices. This can provide a good pointer to applications which should be updated.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/updates-fail-download-adr-error/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Updates Fail to Download in ADR with Error HttpSendRequest failed 0x800701f6 or 0x800701f7 or 0x80070193 In this KB article, we will be reviewing a scenario where third-party software updates may fail to download to a Configuration Manager deployment package when using and automatic deployment rules (ADR). What Causes Error HttpSendRequest failed 502 / 0x800701f6 or 503 / 0x800701f7or 403 / 0x80070193? First, we will dig into the conditions where this issue is most likely to occur. Here are the conditions that may cause this issue to occur: 1. Aproxy is configuredon thesoftware update point site system: 2. The software update point site system is set to use the proxy forautomatic deployment rules content downloads: 3. Theproxy server being useddoesn\u2019t have access to download content from theinternal WSUS server. The third-party software updates are downloaded from theinternal WSUSserver. You can see download information in the following logs for ADRs (RuleEngline.logandPatchDownload.log). In thePatchDownloader.logyou can see the proxy details as well, This will cause an issue when the proxy doesn\u2019t have access to theinternal WSUS server. This is common for proxies that areinternet-basedor even internal proxies thatdon\u2019t allow access or route to internal servers. When the proxy can\u2019t resolve the internal WSUS server, you will often receive an HTTP response error such as: HttpSendRequest failed 502ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x800701f6 OR: HttpSendRequest failed 503ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x800701f7 OR: HttpSendRequest failed 403ERROR: DownloadUpdateContent() failed with hr=0x80070193 Note:The actual error code can vary depending on the proxy configuration. Improvements in Configuration Manager 2002 for Proxies and ADRs This proxy issue was becoming a very common issue with our customers and causing a lot of support cases. We submitted a Configuration Manager UserVoice request:Add Option to Bypass Proxy for Local Address for ADR Content Downloads, and the product group for Configuration Manager made some improvements in build 2002. If the update is published using the WSUS servershostname only and not the FQDN, thePatchDownloadercomponent used for ADR downloads will bypass the proxy. If the download URL for the third-party update is using theFQDN of the internal WSUS server, the proxy will still be used and the downloads will fail if the proxy server can\u2019t access that internal WSUS server URL. After working with the product group, the FQDN is generally used whenWSUS is configured to use SSL. Workaround for Proxy Issue when Using HTTPS WSUS If the improvements in Configuration Manager 2002 don\u2019t resolve your issue due toWSUS using the FQDN, you have another workaround to allow the content to be automatically downloaded. The resolution is to configure the ADR to download the content from theWSUSContent UNC sharerather thanusing the WSUS content URL. Unfortunately, you canonly configure the download location for an ADR is during the initial creation. You are unable to change the download location in the properties of a previously created ADR within the Configuration Manager console. By default, yourWSUSContentfolder should be shared automatically. The WSUSContent folder is the same folder the WSUS website uses for third-party update content downloads. When this setting is enabled, it will allow the ADR to completelybypass the proxyand search the UNC share directly without any HTTP request or proxies. This should resolve the issue if it\u2019s related to a proxy, not allowing traffic to the internal WSUS server. If you have an existing ADR that was configured with the options \u201cDownload software update from the Internet\u201d it is possible the update that existing ADR using a PowerShell cmdlet. Here\u2019s an example of the command you can copy and paste. You will need to update the-nameand-locationparameter to match your environment.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/firefox-esr-not-in-catalog/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Why is the newest version of Firefox ESR not available in the Application Catalog? Symptoms When looking in the Patch My PC Application Catalog, why do I see an older version of Firefox/Thunderbird ESR listed compared to what is available according to theRelease Noteson the Mozilla website? Cause This issue occurs because Mozilla keeps two versions of the Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox/Thunderbird live for three-point releases whenever they issue a major ESR release: An older stable version. A newer version that is potentially unstable but can be rapidly stabilized by Mozilla as issues are resolved. Resolution As Mozilla officially supports both versions, they provide the same vulnerability patches to both versions until they reach their end of life. However, adding newer ESR versions of Firefox/Thunderbird every time Mozilla releases them would significantly increase the number of Firefox/Thunderbird updates in our catalog and potentially introduce complicated applicability considerations. We could add the newer unstable ESR versions as separate products, but these would only be valid during this 3-month transition period. Therefore, at Patch My PC, we have decided only to publish the stable ESR versions of Firefox/Thunderbird, as we assume customers choosing the ESR release are doing so for its stability benefits. Note:For Firefox 115, Mozilla has extended the support ONLY for Windows 7 and 8.1. However, Patch My PC has decided to move up to ESR 128 early October 2024.

From the ConfigMgr console, choose toConnect via Windows PowerShell 2. Define a PowerShell list containg the URL(s) of the missing content referenced in PatchDownloader.log. e.g. $sourceURLs = @(\u2018http://sus01.lab2.local:8530/Content/F5/316611FD021A120AE9FC6A3534A56DF7656F61F5.cab\u2019, \u2018http://sus01.lab2.local:8530/Content/51/F2186E510EA4BD76B93FFBBD686D50D9769F3351.cab\u2019) Run the following snippet (This is a single line PowerShell command). $updateIds = Get-CMSoftwareUpdate -fast | Where-Object { $_.LocalizedCategoryInstanceNames -match \u201cSCUP Updates\u201d } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty CI_ID; $CMPSSuppressFastNotUsedCheck = $true; $updateIds | ForEach-Object { $fullUpdate = Get-CMSoftwareUpdate -Id $_; $sdmPackageXml = $fullUpdate.SDMPackageXML; $updateId = $fullUpdate.CI_UniqueID; $sourceUrl = $sdmPackageXml.DesiredConfigurationDigest.SoftwareUpdate.ConfigurationMetadata.Provider.Operation.Content.FileContent.SourceURL; if ($sourceURLs -contains $sourceUrl) { $fullUpdate | Select-Object LocalizedDisplayName, @{Name=\u2019UpdateId\u2019;Expression={$updateId}}, @{Name=\u2019SourceURL\u2019;Expression={$sourceUrl}} | Format-List } }; $CMPSSuppressFastNotUsedCheck = $false The output will list the Update(s) and Update Id(s) for the missing content. Find the Update and Decline or Re-Publish Now that you have identified the update(s) with missing content, you can find them in the ConfigMgr console by searching for the Unique Update ID. If this is the latest version of the update available in the Patch My PC catalog, you can simplyre-publish the updateto restore the missing content in the WSUS Content folder. If this is an older version of an update or you no longer need it because it is the reason your ADR is failing, you should decline it from WSUS via the Patch My PC Publisher using the following steps. 1. Open the Publisher. 2. From the \u201cUpdates\u201d tab, click \u201cOptions\u201d. 3. Click \u201cRun Wizard\u201d. 4. Search for and select the update(s) with missing content and clickDecline. 5. Perform a Software update Polint Sync for the update to be marked as expired in ConfigMgr. 6. Re-run the failed ADR(s).

This article handles how we handle products that require you tomanually download. Note:the local content repository is for publishing products in our catalog. To see products available in our catalogue, seeSupported Products. To publish products not available in our catalog, seeCustom Apps. Products that Require Manual Download to the Local Content Repository The following products currently require a manual download of the installer files due to apaywall portal, filedownload format,or forEULAreasons: Important:If Oracle JRE or JDK is enabled, you need to download the binaries from theJava SE Downloadspage instead of the Oracle portal. If you download from the Oracle licensing portal, the hash of the binary will be different from our catalog. How the Local Content Repository Works when Using Patch My PC\u2019s Publisher When you enable a product that requires a manual download, you will receive the following message when you clickApply. This message will let you know you need to configure the folder in theAdvanced tabthat our publishing service will use to search for installers that are required for enabled products where the download can\u2019t be performed directly online. The folder you define in theLocal Content Pathwill be the location the publishing service searches through when attempting to publish third-party updates. You will need to download the EXE or MSI installer for products that require manual downloads. In the example above, we defined a UNC path of \u201csccm\\sourcesSoftware UpdatesThird-Party-Updates-Local-Repository\u201c. In this folder, the Java installer files forJava 8 Update 211have been downloaded as shown below.Note:if you use a UNC path, the computer account of the server running the publishing service will needread and modify permissions. We highly recommend enabling email notifications from theAlertstab. If we areunable to locate the installer fileduring a publishing attempt, you will receive an email listing the specific updates that need to be manually downloaded as well as the expected file name. These emails are especially helpful because they will let you know when action is required on your part to download installers when new updates are available for licensed products. How the Local Content Repository Works when Using SCCM In-Console Publishing If you are using SCCM 1806+in-console publishingorSystem Center Updates Publisher (SCUP), you cannot define a custom folder for the local content repository. Instead, you need to use the path specified in the catalog metadata. The path used in the catalog metadata for any licensed updates is:LocalHostPatchMyPCRepository To set this path, create a shared folder on the top-level WSUS/SUP server shared as \u201cPatchMyPCRepository\u201c. Once created, simply download any update installers that require manual downloads from the vendors pay portal. In the example below, we downloaded Java 8 Update 211 and Java SE Development Kit 8 Update 211 into the local content repository folder. You can use the right-click option toShow package infoto gather details such as file name, and version which can be helpful in getting the proper content to place in the local content repository. Note:If multiple products have the same file name, e.g. TeamViewer_Full.msi is the file name for TeamViewer MSI x64 & x32, place each installer in a separate subfolder within your Local Content Repository and the Publisher will find the correct file during the sync. How the Local Content Repository Works (Video Guide) Please review the step-by-step video guide for information on how to publish products that require manual download. Compressed Installers Some vendors publish their installers in the compressed file format. Download the compressed installer and extract the EXE or MSI into the Local Content Repository. The folder you define in theLocal Content Pathwill be the location the publishing service searches through when attempting to publish the app or update. Additional Options Available with Local Content Files There are two additional options in the local content repository menu Delete the update file in the local repository after publishing When this option is checked, whenever a product is published using a content file located in the local content repository folder, the file will beautomatically deleted after publishing. Check the local content repository for content files before attempting to download content files from the internet. When this option is checked, all content files that would typically be downloaded from the internet will first check if the file exists in the local content repository. If the file exists in the local content repository, it will use thelocal filerather thandownloading it from the internet. This option may be helpful is the server is unable to download the content for certain products directly from the internet.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/wsus-signing-certificate-deployment-ci/", "title": "", "raw_text": "WSUS Signing Certificate Deployment within Configuration Manager Deploying the WSUS Code Signing Certificate Within Configuration Manager Using a CI In this article, we will cover how aWSUS signing certificate,or other code-signing certificates can be deployed to your Configuration Manager clients by using aConfiguration Item. A code-signing certificate is a core component in Third-Party Patching. The certificates private key is used to sign the CAB files that will be published to WSUS, and ultimately installed on clients. The client musttrustthis certificate and thecertificate chain. There are use cases where deploying this certificate can be useful via Configuration Item as opposed to something likeGPO, or the built-in Client Settings. One that comes to mind is wanting the monitoring that a Configuration Item provides. Below is a step by step showing how a Configuration Item can be created usingthe script attached here. Additionally, there are steps to help gather the required information. Article Outline: Gathering Info Step 1: Create a New Configuration Item Step 2: Create the Associated Compliance Rule Step 3: Associate the CI with a Configuration Baseline Step 4: Deploy the Configuration Baseline Gathering Info The script itself will need to be edited with your specific Thumbprint and Base64 encoded certificate string. The function contained within the script discusses how to gather these values, but I\u2019ll also note them below. Also, if you are comfortable with Configuration Items within Configuration Manager, you can simply grab the script, adjust for your environment, and deploy away! Certificate Thumbprint:Within the properties of your Code Signing certificate, go to the Details tab and scroll to down to the thumbnail area. This thumbprint will help us uniquely identify the certificate.This can also be copied out of the Patch My PC Publisher, as shown below. Within the properties of your Code Signing certificate, go to the Details tab and scroll to down to the thumbnail area. This thumbprint will help us uniquely identify the certificate. This can also be copied out of the Patch My PC Publisher, as shown below. Base64 Encoded Certificate String:This can be acquired a handful of ways, but a simple way is to get a copy of the certificate as a file and run a PowerShell command similar to the belowSet-Clipboard -Value ([System.Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path .ExportedCert.cer -Encoding Byte))) Set-Clipboard -Value ([System.Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path .ExportedCert.cer -Encoding Byte))) Step 1: Create a New Configuration Item This process will require creating a new Configuration Item, which can be accessed in the context menu as shown below, or within the ribbon when in the node shown. The CI will return a Boolean value, either$trueor$falsebased on the presence of the specified certificate thumbprint. See below, for example, Discovery, and Remediation implementation. Note Data Type is set to Boolean, and the script is modified between Detection and Remediation. A$Remediatevariable is changed based on the purpose of the script. The$CodeSigningCertificateThumbprintand$EncodedCertStringvariables will also need to be populated and should be the same in both scripts. The below screenshots simply show placeholder text. Step 2: Create the Associate Compliance Rule When creating the Configuration Item, you will also configure a Compliance Rule. The compliance rule is the logic that dictates if the remediation script should run, or if the Configuration Item should return compliant or not. Note that we check the box for\u201cRun the specified remediation script when this setting is noncompliant.\u201dThis option is needed to ensure we can perform remediation. Step 3: Associate the CI with a Configuration Baseline With the CI created, we need to create a Configuration Baseline, which can be accessed in the context menu as shown below, or within the ribbon when in the node shown. Alternatively, you could add this CI to an existing baseline you have in place. See the below wizard for an example of the wizard for creating a Configuration Baseline where we are adding our previously created Configuration Item. Step 4: Deploy the Configuration Baseline Finally! The entire point of this article. What you select within this wizard is ultimately up to you. If you want theactionto happen, you, at a minimum, need the check the\u201cRemediate noncompliant rules when supported\u201dcheckbox. Whether you allow this outside maintenance windows, and on what schedule, targeting which devices etc. are all decisions that will be specific to your organization. Assuming all steps were followed, and the values for the base64 string and thumbprint are valid, you should be able to perform aMachine Policy Evaluation Cycleon a client that is targeted with the deployment, and check the Configurations tab as shown below. Once the Configuration Baseline has evaluated as compliant, the certificate should show in theTrusted Root Certificate Authoritiescertificate store and theTrusted Publisherscertificate store and with no \u2018content\u2019 needed! We can store the certificate as a string, very cool!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/when-how-republish-patch-my/", "title": "", "raw_text": "When and How to Republish Patch My PC Third-Party Updates In this article, the topic of republishing updates in Patch My PC will be explained in detail. What is Republishing WSUS Updates Republishing an update means the selected update(s) will bepublished to WSUS with a new update ID.This effectively creates an entirely new update. It will appear as a separate item in the WSUS, and in Configuration Manager. More importantly,the update will have a new content path and content hash. As shown below, a republished update will have the name appended with \u2018(Republished on )\u2019. Within the Publisher, we offer an option when republishing an update to supersede \u2018previously published update(s) for these product(s)\u2019, which will be discussed later in this article. ConfigMgr Apps Republishing a ConfigMgr App means that the selected application(s) will have its content recreated and its revision incremented while retaining its package ID. Why Would an Application or Update Need Republishing There are four scenarios that would require an update to be republished. Those scenarios, and the reason the republish is needed, are below. Published updates\u2019 content wasremoved from WSUSContentIf the update\u2019s content is no longer in WSUSContent, then Configuration Manager will fail to download the software update into a Deployment Package with a404 (not found)error. If the update\u2019s content is no longer in WSUSContent, then Configuration Manager will fail to download the software update into a Deployment Package with a404 (not found)error. Aright-click optionis used thatadds content to an updateAdd custom pre/post update installation scriptsAdd MST transformation fileBranding/logo changed forManage conflicting processes\u2026 Add custom pre/post update installation scripts Add MST transformation file Branding/logo changed forManage conflicting processes\u2026 TheWSUS code signing certificate has been updatedRepublishing updates would code sign them with your updated certificate Republishing updates would code sign them with your updated certificate Aright-click optionis selected that wouldadd PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe to the updateAuto close application processes before installationSkip installation when the application is in useDelete desktop shortcut(s) created by this applicationDisable self-updaterManage installation loggingModify command line Auto close application processes before installation Skip installation when the application is in use Delete desktop shortcut(s) created by this application Disable self-updater Manage installation logging Modify command line Note:In scenario 4 above, a republish is only needed for thefirst selected right click optionfrom the list. For example, you right click an update and none of the 6 options listed under scenario 4 are checked.After you check one of them, a republish will be necessary so that the PatchMyPc-ScriptRunner.exe can be added to the update content.Any additional options from the list can then be checkedwithouta republish. This is because additional options are simply a command line update that is an update revision.No additional binary changes are needed once PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe ispresentfor the scenario 4 options right-click options. You can check to see if an update hasScriptRunner.exepresent by looking in the update CAB file in the WSUS content folder. Publisher Notifications Regarding Republishing The Publisher will create log entries and alerts if it detects that updates require republishing. Aloglinewill appear in the PatchMyPc.log file such as the below. Apple iTunes 12.10.8.5 (x64) previously published without custom actions, republish update to receive newly added custom actions. See https://patchmypc.com/faq-scup-catalog#republishing-updates for details on republishing updates. Additionally,if the Teams Alerts are configuredyou will receive a message similar to below. Similarly, if theSMTP based alertsare configured, theemail report will include a noticesuch as below. Receiving any of these alerts, or log entries would indicate that the specified update should be republished. The process for republishing can be found below. How to Republish Updates Once you determine what product(s) meet the criteria described above for requiring a republish operation you canright-click the product, vendor, or all products level and choose the\u2018Republish update(s) for these product(s) during next sync schedule\u2018 You will be prompted to verify that you do want tomark these update(s) for republishing. The popup also includes scenarios for republishing. If you selectYes, you will be prompted to verify if you want tosupersede the currently published updatesfor this product when the new updates are republished. The popup also includes some details on how you can optionally expire those previously published updates. Note:If you select \u201cNo\u201d in the above prompt you willcontinue to receive warningsfrom the Publisher stating that the update could not be revised. To stop these warnings in this scenario you will want to decline the update which is failing to revise using themodify published updates wizard. The republishing of the selected updates will occur during the next publishing service sync. You can trigger this sync to happen right away by clicking theRun Publishing Service Syncin theSync Scheduletab. If you review thePatchMyPC.log,you should see the updates being republished. Republished updates will have the date appended to the update title here\u2019s an example:Google Chrome 84.0.4147.105 (x64) \u2013 (Republished on 2020-09-22 at 11:52) Optionally you can use theWSUS Optionsin theUpdatestab of the Publisher todisable the appending of the republish tag. See below for an example of the option. With the checkbox checked republished updateswill not have the republished tag, but would still supersede old updates if requested. Once the republishing has completed, the updates will show up in SCCM after the next software update point sync has occurred. You can force a sync to happen by clicking \u2018Synchronize Software Updates\u2018 in the Configuration Manager Console. You can monitor the SCCM software update point sync by reviewing thewsyncmgr.log. Once the sync is complete, you should see the newly republished update(s) in the console with the date appended as described above. If you choose tosupersedepreviously published updates for this product, you will see the previous update(s) as superseded as well as indicated by theiricon, and a \u2018Yes\u2019 in the superseded column. Note that the update has our appended republish date, and our previous update is now marked superseded.

Determine if You are Affected This error generally will occur when attempting toinstall third-party software updates. You may see the following error in software center based on thedeployment visibility. InWUAHandler.log, you will see the following error in the log. Failed to download updates to the WUAgent datastore. Error = 0x800b0109Failed to download updates to the WUAgent datastore. Error = 0x8024b303 If the certificate exists inTrusted Root, but notTrusted Publisherson the client, you may see the following error instead. Failed to download updates to the WUAgent datastore. Error = 0x800b0004. 0x800b0109 = A certificate chainprocessed,but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.0x800b0004 = The subject is not trusted for the specified action. This error occurs when a client is attempting to install an update signed by aWSUS signing certificatethat the client doesn\u2019t trustor theallow third-party updates policy isn\u2019t enabled. Step 1: Check if the WSUS Signing Certificate is Deployed to the Client Device The most common reason error0x800b0109or0x8024b303occurs is that the specificWSUS signing certificateisn\u2019tproperly deployedto the client device. The signing certificate needs to be in theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store. It\u2019s important to review the certificate used to sign thespecific update failingas we often see the failing update was signed using a previous certificate that may not be deployed to clients. To find the certificate used for the update perform the following actions: 1.Get theUpdateIDfor the update failing. TheUpdateIDcan be found in the line before the error message in theWUAHandler.log. 2. Downloadthe update CAB file using the Configuration Manager console. Navigate toAll Software Updates>Search UpdateID>PropertiesofUpdate>Content Informationtab >Ctrl + Cto copy theSource Path>Pasteto Notepad and remove non-URL text 3.Downloadorcopythe .CAB file to the client receiving error0x800b0109 / 0x8024b303. Onpropertiesof the file, review theCertification Pathtab, and review if there are any trust errors. If the certificate shows anytrust errors, you will need todeploy this certificate to all client devices. 4.If the certificate appears to betrustedandvalid, you should next validate the certificate exist in both theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store on the client. 4.1Take note of thethumbprintof the WSUS signing certificate from theDetailstab of the .CAB file as shown instep 3. Opencertlm.mscon the client receiving the error and check if the certificate exists in bothTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate stores by checking thesubject nameandthumbprint. 4.2If the certificate appears is installed in bothTrusted RootandTrusted Publishers, and you still receive0x800b0109 / 0x8024b303, you also need to validate the settingAllow signed updates for an intranet Microsoft update service locationis enabled and deployed. Important:We often see cases where theWSUS signing certificate is updated, andonlythenewest WSUS signing certificateis deployed to the client. If there where any updates signed using a previous certificate, that certificate also needs to be deployed to client devices, orupdates published before the new certificate was createdwill fail with error0x800b0109. Step 2: Check policy: Allow signed updates for an intranet Microsoft update service location If the certificate appears to be installed inTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherson the client, and you still receive error0x800b0109or0x8024b303, it\u2019s likely due to the policyAllow signed updates for an intranet Microsoft update service locationnot being enabled. To check if the policy is enabled perform the following actions: 1.Open regedit.exe, and navigate to:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate:AcceptTrustedPublisherCerts=1 | (REG_DWORD). If enabled, you will see the RegValueAcceptTrustedPublisherCertsset to1as aREG_DWORD 2.If the value isn\u2019t set,updates will fail to installwith error0x800b0109. You can use aConfiguration Manager client settingorgroup policyto deploy this policy to devices. Important:Please ensure that the \u2018Type\u2018of the RegValue is \u2018REG_DWORD\u2018 andNOT\u2018REG_QWORD\u2018 Step 3: Check if 0x800b0109 is a Scan Error, not an Update Install Error We periodically have customers mistakenly think that error0x800b0109is happening when installing third-party updates, but it\u2019s actually occurring when trying toscan against the WSUS server. If WUAHandler.log contains the error below containing the wordsOnSearchCompleteorScan failed,then your issue is actually related to the client not trusting the SSL certificate used by the WSUS server. OnSearchComplete \u2013 Failed to end search job. Error = 0x80244010.Scan failed with error = 0x80244010. To resolve the error in this scenario, you will need to install theRoot Certificate Authorityfor the CA that issue the SSL certificate to the WSUS server on the client. One option to do this is usingGroup Policy. Video Resolution Guide for Error 0x800b0109 To resolve error code0x800b0109 / 0x8024b303,you need to distribute the WSUS signing certificate to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate stores on your client devices. We also have a detailed step-by-step video guide below that covers deploying the WSUS signing certificate using SCCM 1806+ or using group policy toresolve error 0x800b0109 on your clients. If you prefer a non-video format, you can use the following guides to distribute the WSUS signing certificate: Third-party software updates feature in SCCM 1806+ \u2013 (Microsoft Docs) Deploy the certificate using group policy \u2013 (PDF Guide).

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/intune-application-creation-options/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Application Creation Options Explained In this article, we will cover all of the Intune Application Creation Options that are available from the publisher. These are options that apply specifically to the creation of Win32 applications for your Intune tenant. Below is a screenshot of this section as of the writing of this article. This article does not go over configuring Authority, Application ID, and Application Secret. For documentation on configuring these items please refer to our setup documentation for Intunehere. Digitally sign the detection method script and enforce signature checking on the application in Intune When this option is checked, it will enforce signature checking for the detection method script. This option will be reflected in the application\u2019s properties in your Intune tenant under Detection Rules. If this option is enabled, you will need to browse for a code-signing certificate from your local computer\u2019s personal store to sign the Powershell detection method scripts for all created applications. If you also use our product for MEMCM (SCCM), you can use your WSUS code signing certificate that you previously created also to sign the detection method script for Intune apps, as long you are running the service from the same server. Alternatively, you can generate a code signing certificate to sign the detection method script (How to generate a code signing certificate and sign PowerShell .ps1 script \u2013 Patch My PC). The certificate will still need to be deployed to your Intune-managed clients for the script to be trusted. Copy the assignments from previously created applications when an updated application is created The Publisher can immediately add assignments for the apps to Azure AD groups upon creation. This option can be executed through a right-click action at a global, vendor, or individual level. Right-clicking a product, vendor, or All Products will give you the option to Manage Assignments. From this window, you can add an assignment for an app or apps as Available, Required, or as an Uninstall. When a new version of an app is created, and the box to copy assignments in the Intune Options window is checked, the Publisher will automatically transfer these assignments to the newly created application. The assignments will not be transferred if you enable this option after the fact, while the newer version already exists in Intune. Update Enrollment Status Page associations with new application when an updated application is created This option will ensure that the list of selected Win32 applications for an IntuneEnrollment Status Pageis kept up to date as new versions of applications are published. These Enrollment Status Pages are commonly used during Autopilot. With this checkbox checked the Publisher will ensure the latest version of the published application are associated with your ESP. The ESP associations will not be removed from older versions of Patch My PC-made Intune Win32 packages if you enable this option after the fact, while the newer version already exists in Intune. Delete the assignments from previously created applications when an updated application is created This option corresponds with \u2018Copy Assignments\u2026\u2018feature from above. When the Publisher creates a new version of an application or update, the old version will still exist in the Intune tenant (unless specified to be deleted ie.1or2). This Win32 application will still have the same assignments that were set before the new version was created. If thecopy assignments optionis set you will end up having two different versions of the same Win32 application assigned to your Intune clients. To avoid this, you would want to enable this option to delete the assignments of the old application, so that only the latest version of the application is assigned to your clients. The assignments will not be deleted if you enable this option after the fact, while the newer version already exists in Intune. Update application dependencies from previously created applications when an updated application is created This option will support maintaining your application dependencies in Intune. When this option is enabled, if you have any Win32 apps from Patch My PC in the application dependencies you create, it will ensure that they are kept up to date as new versions are published. Note:When this option is enabled, the notification below will display. Previously, if you had a dependency change the applications would not go away. With this option enabled, there is a possibility that applications can be deleted. Copy the requirements from previously created applications or updates when an updated application is created When enabled, this option ensures that any customer-definedWin32 requirementsare retained as new versions of a product are updated. For example, the customer might add a custom requirement PowerShell script or registry value check. This will be copied forward as long as the checkbox is checked. Note:If this feature is not enabled, then customer-defined requirements will not be retained. When a new version of a product is published, the additional requirements will not exist on the newly published Win32 application. The Publisher will never delete a requirement; they are simply not copied forward.\u00c2 Delete any previously created applications when an updated application is created As explained in Option 2 and 4, when the Publisher runs a sync and finds a new version is released for an application, it will create the new version of the application. Without selecting this option, the old version of the application will still exist in the Intune tenant. If this option is enabled, however, the Publisher will delete the old version of the application when the new version is created. Select this option if you only want to have the latest version of an application that exists in your Intune tenant. Note:Beginning in version 2.0.1 we support the ability to retain a limited number of previous versions for both updates and applications. Setting the value will allow you to preserve the specified number of previous versions. This provides you with the benefit of having access to older versions of applications in your environment, as well as the latest, ready to deploy if you need to roll back your devices to a last known good version. It also keeps your environment tidy by maintaining a set number of applications. Delete any previously created updates when a new update is published As explained above, when the Publisher runs a sync and finds a new version is released for an application it will create the new version of the application as an Intune Update. Without selecting this option, the old version of the Intune Update will still exist in the Intune tenant. If this option is enabled, however, the Publisher will delete the old version of the Intune Update when the new version is created. Select this option if you only want to have the latest version of an Intune Update that exists in your Intune tenant. Enable \u2018Allow available uninstall\u2019 When creating or configuring a Win32 app, there is a setting to provide the uninstall option for the app for users in the Company Portal. All Win32 apps published will inherit this flag if the option is set at this global level.

This error is related to updates failing to publish with full content due to a certificate trust issue in Configuration Manager. If you are experiencing this issue, you will see the following errors in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.loglog file. SyncUpdate: Certificate \u2018%CERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT%\u2019 is BLOCKED.SyncUpdate: ff1bb935-7ecd-482f-988e-ba7fafe0eacf \u2013 Signature check on downloaded binary has failed.STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_TRUST_FAIL).STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_FAIL). How Certificate Trust Works for Third-Party Update Catalogs When yousubscribe to a third-party software update catalogin the Configuration Manager console, you will be required to accept the primary certificate used to sign the catalog file. During the catalog export, we will also includecode-signing certificates from the installer filesfor updates within our catalog. For example, in the extracted catalog in the screenshot below, you can see a certificate used tocode-sign Dropbox\u2019s installer. During a catalog sync in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.log, you can review thecertificates being importedinto Configuration Manager from a third-party update catalog. Why The STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_TRUST_FAIL). Error? Before any third-party update can be published to WSUS, the SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT component will alwaysperform a certificate check on the downloaded update file. When an update file is downloaded, and the code-signing certificateisn\u2019t trustedwithin Configuration Manager, you will receive the error: STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_TRUST_FAIL). Within the Configuration Manager Console, you can navigate toAdministration>Security>Certificates You can then right-click the certificate of the blocked certificate and clickUnblock. Once unblocked, you should be able to go back to the update and choosePublish Third-Party Software Update Content,and it should publish successfully. Why was the Certificate Blocked in Configuration Manager There are two primary reasons a certificate may be blocked. Youunsubscribedfrom the catalog that imported the Third-party Software Update Content certificate The certificate wasblockedfrom the console We forgot to include the certificate in our catalog If you believe it\u2019s the last point, you canopen a support case, and attach yourSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.logfile.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/standalone-wsus-mode/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Configuring Standalone WSUS Mode Description This article will show you how the Patch My PC Publisher can be set up to publish updates in astandalone WSUSenvironment. A full guide on how to configure WSUS standalone can be found here:WSUS Standalone \u2013 Getting Started (patchmypc.com). Configuring Standalone WSUS Mode You can publish third-party updates tostandalone WSUSwithout SCCM. To allow updates to appeardirectly in WSUS, follow the instructions in this article. Standalone WSUS mode isonly required when you are not using Configuration Managerfor software updates and areonly using WSUS. When enabled, published third-party updates will appear directly in the WSUS console. Enable Standalone WSUS Mode To enable standalone WSUS mode, go to theUpdatestab and selectOptions. In theWSUS optionswindow check the boxMake updates appear in the WSUS console. This option isn\u2019t needed if using Configuration Manager. If your WSUS database is using aWindows Internal Database(WID), thedatabase connection options will be read-only. When using aSQL Server for the WSUS database, you will need to choose either to connect to the database using theSYSTEM accountor define a user name and password usingSQL authentication. Verify Third-Party Updates Appear in the WSUS Console Any updates published after this setting was enabled should appear directly in the WSUS console. You can now deploy the third-party updates just like a Microsoft updatedirectly from the WSUS console. If updates were publishedbefore this setting was enabled, they wouldnot appear in the WSUS console automatically. For updates published before WSUS Standalone mode was enabled, use theModify Published Updates Wizardto make those updates appear in the WSUS console. SQL permissions required to publish update information to the database When the Patch My PC Publishing Sync runs, if the SUSDB is remote from the WSUS Standalone server, you would have to grant specific permissions to the computer account where PMPC is installed for it to be able to update information. The script below can be used to grant those permissions. Make sure to replace the computer account values with the ones appropriate to your environment. The code can be edited, and run as a SQL query to grant the permissions.

Edit or remove this text inline or in the module Content settings. You can also style every aspect of this content in the module Design settings and even apply custom CSS to this text in the module Advanced settings. Workaround: Manually delete all .tmp files As a temporary workaround to enable you to download the software updates now, you can manually delete all .tmp files in the %temp% directory. Note that this is not a practical solution as the issue will invaraibly return because something is stopping Windows / applications from cleaning up temporary files. If downloading software updates mmanually via right click > Download, %temp% will resolve to youruser profile\u2019s temp directory\u2013 typically this is inAppData. If downloading software updates automatically via ADR, this will be in the system\u2019s context and will generally beC:\\Windows\\Temp. Note:The system environment variabletempcan be changed. To verify your system\u2019s temp directory, execute the below PowerShell snippet: Solution: Create antivirus exceptions Create an exclusion policy in your security software to exclude .tmp files in your or your system\u2019s temp directory. The temp directory which you exclude depends on whether you experience the issue while downloading manually or via ADR. If downloading software updates mmanually via right click > Download, %temp% will resolve to youruser profile\u2019s temp directory\u2013 typically this is inAppData. If downloading software updates automatically via ADR, this will be in the system\u2019s context and will generally beC:\\Windows\\Temp. Note:The system environment variabletempcan be changed. To verify your system\u2019s temp directory, execute the below PowerShell snippet: Solution: Verify NTFS permissions Another possible solution could be that the security context trying to conduct the downloads does not have the NTFS permission to delete files. Therefore ensure your user or system object has theDeleteNTFS permission in the temp directory. If downloading software updates mmanually via right click > Download, %temp% will resolve to youruser profile\u2019s temp directory\u2013 typically this is inAppData. If downloading software updates automatically via ADR, this will be in the system\u2019s context and will generally beC:\\Windows\\Temp. Note:The system environment variabletempcan be changed.

Introduction When you deployIntune Updatespublished by the Patch My PC Publishing Service for some devices the Intune deployment statistics might sayNot Applicable. The status details in such cases will statePowershell script requirement rule is not met. Additional information Each Intune Update published by Patch My PC contains in its Properties a requirement script. Intune runs this requirement script to determine if the update you targeted the device with applies or not.Therefore, before installing the update, Intune invokes the script, which returns: True, if an older version is installed on the device. False, if an older version isn\u2019t installed on the device. Note:Intune Updates will only work if the version already on the device matches the type of installer (like EXE or MSI) and the system architecture (like x64 or x86) of the update you\u2019re sending out. Recommendations If you want to update software on your devices, like Google Chrome, you can pick all the Google Chrome updates from theIntune Updatessection and deploy them. Then, Intune takes care of installing the necessary updates on the devices. We don\u2019t recommend selecting every software available in the Patch My PC Publisher or it\u2019s Cloud counterpart, however, as you might run into the Intune policy size limit issue documentedhere. Troubleshooting If you find that Intune Updates aren\u2019t being applied even though an older version is installed, you\u2019ll need to troubleshoot the issue. Here\u2019s what we need: The name of the update that is not installing (e.g. Update for Google Chrome, or Update for Notepad++) From the device on which the update is not applying, collectthese logs.Make sure to include the rolled-over logs as well.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/hardware-inventory-scan-sccm/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Understanding the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle in Configuration Manager Over a year ago, we published anarticleon the PatchTuesday tech blog discussing the various Configuration Manager (or simply ConfigMgr) Client actions, including the one we\u2019ll discuss today \u2013 the Hardware Inventory scan cycle. The article detailed what each does, when it\u2019s useful to trigger a specific action, and the relevant logs to monitor on the client side. The article was written because the information was highly relevant to many people at the time. That article provided a general overview of all the available actions. In this article, we\u2019ll examine one of the most powerful actions: the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle. We\u2019ll discuss the data it collects, how to configure its automatic execution, and the various methods to trigger it manually. What is the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle? Before answering this question, we need to know what the hardware inventory is.Briefly put, it is a collection of detailed information about client devices in your environment. The scan cycle triggers the collection of data from your devices.By default, the hardware inventory data collection is disabled in Configuration Manager. You will have to enable it by following the stepsprovided by Microsoft. What does it do, and what data does it collect? The Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle collects a wide range of data about the hardware configuration of client devices, including: Processor details: Type, speed, and number of cores. Memory information: Total physical memory and available memory. Storage details: Disk drives, partitions, and available space. Network information: Network adapters, IP addresses, and MAC addresses. Peripheral devices: Monitors, keyboards, and mice. System details: BIOS version, manufacturer, and model. Last but not least,Installed software: A list of installed programs and updates. Note:Yes, the software inventory data is collected by the Hardware Inventory Cycle, not by Software Scan Cycle. Configuring Automatic Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle To configure the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle to run automatically, follow these steps: Open the ConfigMgr consoleand navigate toAdministration > Client Settings. Edit theDefault Client Settingsor create a new, custom client settings policy. Right-click on your client settings, selectProperties, and go to theHardware Inventorysection. Enable hardware inventory and configure the schedule for the inventory scan cycle (e.g., every 7 days). Apply the settings and deploy the client settings policy to the desired collection.Note: It\u2019s not needed to deploy the client settings if you edit the Default Client Settings. This setup ensures the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle runs automatically according to the specified schedule. Ways to manually invoke the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle In some cases, you might need to trigger the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle manually instead of waiting for the automated sync. Here are several methods to do so: 1. From the Client Side One method is by using the Control PanelConfiguration ManagerApplet: Open theControl Panelon the client device. Go toSystem and Security> Configuration Manager. In the Actions tab, select Hardware Inventory Cycle and click Run Now. The other method of manually invoking the scan cycle from a client is by using PowerShell: Open PowerShell as Administrator Run this command:Invoke-WmiMethod -Namespace \u201crootCCM\u201d -Class SMS_Client -Name TriggerSchedule -ArgumentList \u201c{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}\u201d Invoke-WmiMethod -Namespace \u201crootCCM\u201d -Class SMS_Client -Name TriggerSchedule -ArgumentList \u201c{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}\u201d 2. Using PowerShell Remoting PowerShell remoting may or may not be enabled in your organization. Some orgs prefer to disable it, as they consider it a security risk.Truth be told, it can be a security risk if not properly configured. But that\u2019s not the scope of this article. Here is how to invoke the scan cycle on a remote computer within your network: Open PowerShell as Admin with an account that has PowerShell Remoting privileges. Run this code:Invoke-Command -ComputerName EnterComputerName -ScriptBlock {Invoke-WmiMethod -Namespace \u201crootccm\u201d -Class \u201csms_client\u201d -Name \u201cTriggerSchedule\u201d -ArgumentList \u201c{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}\u201d} Invoke-Command -ComputerName EnterComputerName -ScriptBlock {Invoke-WmiMethod -Namespace \u201crootccm\u201d -Class \u201csms_client\u201d -Name \u201cTriggerSchedule\u201d -ArgumentList \u201c{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}\u201d} 3. From the SCCM Console Open the ConfigMgr console and navigate toAssets and Compliance>Devices. Locate the device and right-click on it. In theClient Notificationsection, chooseCollectHardware Inventory. 4. Using Support Center Client Tools This is also a client-sided tool, but I wanted to allocate an additional section to it. This tool can be distributed to your devices with the MSI that resides in your \u201c%ConfigMgr Install Directory%toolsSupport Center\u201d. With the MSI installed, you will find an app namedConfiguration Manager Support Center Client Tools. This tool will give you more information about the Configuration Manager agent on the device, such as: Client information (assigned Management Point, Site Code, Client Version, etc), Policy details Content details, deployments, cache information, etc Troubleshooting Log viewer The most important, however, is theInventory. It can give you information on when the last hardware inventory was performed: If you\u2019re curious about the information stored in the WMI collected by the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle, this tool can give you that insight as well: This option can be useful if you\u2019re setting additional classes to be collected by the hardware inventory, and you\u2019re curious to know if it\u2019s collected, it\u2019s one option to check. But back to the topic. If you wish to trigger a Hardware Inventory cycle, do this: Open Configuration Manager Support Center Client Tools Navigate to theInventorytab Click on theInvoke triggerdropdown SelectHardware inventory cycleif you want to run a Delta sync.OR SelectAdvancedand thenHardware inventory cycle (full resynchronization)to run a full sync. 5. Using Advanced Insights If you\u2019re unaware,Advanced Insightsis an innovative reporting and patch compliance solution for Configuration Manager offered by Patch My PC. Among the very useful information this tool offers (and I encourage you to check it out, as it might be something your org can benefit from), it allows you to trigger some client actions, including the cycle we are discussing today. To trigger the cycle, follow these steps: Access the Advanced Insights reporting website Navigate to Resources \u00e0 Devices \u00e0 Managed devices and locate your device using the Quick Search option. From theActionsdropdown, select theHardware Inventoryoption. Viewing the data using Resource Explorer Once the data is collected, you probably want to view it. Here\u2019s how: Open the ConfigMgr console and navigate toAssets and Compliance>Devices. Locate and select the desired device. Right-click on the device and chooseStart>Resource Explorer. In the Resource Explorer Window, you can browse the various categories to see the information collected from clients, such as Installed applications, Operating System, Network adapters, and more.This information can be used to create a dynamic collection, for example. Relevant logs to monitor on the client side If you want to monitor the evaluation of this action, it can be done using these logs located on the client side in the %WinDir%\\CCM\\Logs folder: InventoryAgent.log\u2013 Records activities of hardware inventory, software inventory, and heartbeat discovery actions on the client. InventoryProvider.log\u2013 More details about hardware inventory, software inventory, and heartbeat discovery actions on the client. If you trigger aDeltahardware inventory scan, this is how the InventoryAgent.log will look like: Note:Don\u2019t worry about the Warning messages. If a class the hardware inventory scan cycle is supposed to collect data for, but the class doesn\u2019t exist on the device and there is no data to collect, you\u2019ll see the warning. However, if you trigger a full hardware inventory sync using the Support Center Client Tools, this is how the log is going to look like: Every time a delta hardware inventory sync is performed, the minor version is incremented (e.g., from 6.1 to 6.2). When a full hardware inventory sync is performed, the major version is incremented, and the minor version resets (e.g., from 6.2 to 7.0). When the site server receives a new report from the client, the client is instructed to perform a delta or full inventory sync if the version does not match what the server expects. Conclusion In conclusion, the Hardware Inventory Scan Cycle in ConfigMgr plays an important part in keeping a current list of your organization\u2019s hardware. Knowing how to set it up and run it manually, as well as which logs to check, helps IT administrators manage and troubleshoot hardware inventory. The Resource Explorer makes it easy to view and analyze the collected data, leading to better asset management, compliance, and efficiency in the IT infrastructure.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/update-cab-files-deleted-from/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Update CAB Files Deleted from WSUSContent when Using Shared SUSDB We\u2019ve recently seen an increase in customer cases where published third-party software update (.CAB files) are automatically deleted from theWSUSContent folder. For this scenario, it occurs when customers are using ashared SUSDBamongmultiple WSUS servers. Determine if You are Affected The first step to determine if this could be your issue is to check if you havemultiple WSUS servers(Software Update Points in ConfigMgr) using the sameSUSDB. The most accurate way to check if multiple servers are using the same SUSDB is toconnect to the SUSDB using SQL Server Management Studio. Once connected, run the followingSQL commands: UseSUSDBexecspGetFrontEndServers The result of this query should listall WSUS front end serversusing the sameSUSDB. If there aren\u2019t multiple servers listed in theServerNamecolumn, this blog post will not be related to your issue. If affected, you will see.CAB updates automatically be deletedright after the publishing is completed. In many cases, this will happen so fast you will not see the file appear unless you runProcmonto verify it was created. You will likely only see a new folder created in theWSUSContent directorythat is empty, and the third-party update will fail to download to a deployment package witherror 404. Why the Third-Party Update CAB Files are Auto-Deleting If this is your scenario, we\u2019ll dig into our findings after working with multiple customers having this same issue. The big thing to note when using a shared SUSDB with multiple WSUS servers is what WSUS server is acting as theNLBMasterFrontEndServer. From a third-party update perspective, theNLBMasterFrontEndServeris theWSUS server that performs hash validationafter a third-party software update is published to the WSUSContent folder. WSUS has a stored procedure (spUpdateServerHealthStatus) that will automatically change the WSUS server that holds theNLBMasterFrontEndServerrole if the currentNLBMasterFrontEndServerserver has beenunavailable for 5 minutes. This includes the server being offline, WSUS service stopped, or database connectivity issues. To determine what WSUS front end server currently holds theNLBMasterFrontEndServerrole, you can run the following query against theSUSDB. select*fromtbReference In the example below, we can see theNLBMasterFrontEndServeris set toSITESYSTEM.CONTOSO.LOCAL. The publishing of updates is being performed from the WSUS serverDEMO4.CONTOSO.LOCAL, because it is the top-level software update point within our Configuration Manager environment. The root cause for the actual .CAB files being deleted is because theNLBMasterFrontEndServerserver doesn\u2019t trust the WSUS signing certificate from the WSUS server that is performing the publishing of third-party updates. Within theWSUS log file(C:\\Program Files\\Update ServicesLogFilesSoftwareDistribution.log) on theNLBMasterFrontEndServer(SITESYSTEM.CONTOSO.LOCALin our scenario), you will actually be able to see the CAB files being deleted. CabUtilities.CheckCertificateSignature File cert verification failed for demo4j$WSUS\\WsusContent7E88A3263D0FBFB63F57D93A0322958B051B18B97E.cab with 2148204809ContentSyncAgent.WakeUpWorkerThreadProc Importing file 88A3263D0FBFB63F57D93A0322958B051B18B97E failed at file cert verificationContentSyncAgent.WakeUpWorkerThreadProc Invalid file deleted: demo4j$WSUS\\WsusContent7E88A3263D0FBFB63F57D93A0322958B051B18B97E.cab The error code2148204809mentioned in the log above translates toA certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider. How to Resolve CAB File Auto-Deletion for Third-Party Updates The previous section gives insight into the root cause of the issue which is theNLBMasterFrontEndServerdoesn\u2019t trust theWSUS Signing Certificatefrom the WSUS server performing the publishing. The fix is toexport the WSUS Signing Certificatefrom the server performing the publishing and install it in theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store on theNLBMasterFrontEndServerWSUS server. If are using thePatch My PC Publisher, you canexportthe WSUS Signing Certificate from the general tab to a(.CER file). If you are not using the Publisher, you canexportthe WSUS Signing Certificate using the following steps: Opencertlm.mscon the WSUS server performing the publishing Click theWSUSstore Right-clicktheWSUS Signing Certificate>All Tasks>Export = In theExport Private Keydialog, be sure to choose the option \u201cNo, do not export the private key\u201c Copy the(.CER certificate file)from the WSUS server that it was exported from (DEMO4.CONTOSO.LOCAL in our case) to theNLBMasterFrontEndServer(SITESERVER.CONTOSO.LOCAL in our case). On theNLBMasterFrontEndServerWSUS server, open the(.CER certificate file). In theCertificate Pathtab, you will likely see the certificate shows an error similar to the one below: On the General tab of the certificate, clickInstall Certificate\u2026button In theCertificate Import WizardchooseLocal Machinefor theStore Location Click the radio buttonPlace all certificates in the following storeand browse toTrusted Root Certification Authorities Once installed toTrusted Root Certification Authorities,repeat the certificate installationsteps above, but choose the certificate storeTrusted Publishers Important:The WSUS Signing Certificate must be installed at both theTrusted Root Certification AuthoritiesandTrusted Publishers Once theWSUS Signing Certificateis installed on theNLBMasterFrontEndServerWSUS server, any future published updates should not be automatically deleted. For any third-party update (.CAB files) that have already been deleted, you will need to republish those products as new updates using the articleWhen and How to Republish Patch My PC Third-Party Updates Note:The WSUS Signing Certificate should be installed onall devices in your environment.

Root cause Depending on whether you\u2019re using the SCCM console to download the updates, or using ADR, it\u2019s going to by either the user running the SCCM console or the SYSTEM account of the site server missing SMB/NTFS permissions on the Deployment Package\u2019s source path. The solution is toreview the SMB and NTFS permissionsof the source path used for the Deployment Package. If you\u2019re seeing this error while using ADRs,verify the SYSTEM account of the site server has the necessary read/write permissions. If you\u2019re seeing this error while using the SCCM console,verify the user running the console has the necessary read/write permissions. Solution: Verify SMB and NTFS Permissions on Deployment Package Source Path First you need to find out what the source path is for your Deployment Package. Right click the Deployment Packageyou, or your ADR, is trying to download to and chooseProperties: Go to the directory in File Explorer andverify the user or computer object has at least Modify permissionin theSecuritytab of the folder\u2019s Properties: Note:It\u2019s not necessary to directly add the user or computer object here. It is possible to use Active Directory groups to contain users or computer objects. If the NTFS permissions look fine, next you will need to verify SMB permissions on the shared folder itself. For example, in the above screenshots the Deployment Package source path isdemo3SourcesSoftware UpdatesPatch My PC Updates. We need to verify the SMB permission on theSourcesshared folder. The instructions to verify SMB permissions will vary between platforms, i.e. it\u2019s possible to create a shared folder from Synology or NetApp systems. The below detail is specific to a shared folder hosted on a Windows operating systeml. Open up theComputer Managementmmc snap in (protip: right click on the start menu and chooseComputer Management), expandShared Foldersand selectShares: Right click on the shared folder in the centre pane and chooseProperties. In this case I will right click onSources. Go to theShare Permissionstab andverify the user or computer object has at least Change permission. As you can see from the above, only theEveryoneobject is in the Access Control List (ACL) with only theReadpermission. This will need changing to allow the user or computer object access to the shared folder with theChangepermission. Whether you remove theEveryoneobject and use specific identity objects is your discretion. In any case, you would need to make sure the needed user or computer object is granted Change or Modify permissions, for both the SMB and NTFS permissions respectively.

History it is generally a bad practice to have an open/anonymous/unauthenticated relay for messaging on the internet, as a messaging server that is either intentionally or unintentionally configured in such a way to allow messages from any source to be routed through the relay completely transparently. This type of configuration is very sought after and can be used maliciously if discovered. Exchange Online does not allow this type of relay by default, and configuring one is somewhat obfuscated. We will not discuss how to configure that here today. Where such a relay is not configured, systems must authenticate against a standard relay to be permitted to send emails, which is the preferred approach. However, Exchange Online, by default (as of a recent change \u2013 2023), does not allow basic authentication or the use of SMTP authentication. The default now is Modern authentication (Oauth 2.0 token-based authenticate), which uses tokens and provide enhanced security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Disabling basic authentication helps protect against attacks like credential stuffing, brute force, and phishing, which helps improve the overall security of Exchange Online environments. That said, this type of relay is still a common requirement for many organizations with internal web, app, or database servers, monitoring applications, or MFPs that can generate emails but cannot always send them without using such a relay. Additionally, many of these applications, servers, and MFPs cannot perform the actions required to use Modern authentication, especially if something like MFA is configured. Lastly, in newer tenants, all of this is topped off by Authenticated SMTP being blocked, even if you turn it on for 1 mailbox, if Security Defaults are enabled in your Entra ID Tenant. Note: Basic Auth is now deprecated in Exchange Online \u2013https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online/https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/improving-security-together/ba-p/805892 Determine if you are affected. When providing an email address and password for email authentication in the Publishers alerts tab, if that mailbox does not SMTP authentication enabled, you will see the following error message. An error occurred while sending the test mail: The SMTP server requires a secure connection, or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.7.57 Client not authenticated to send mail. Error: 535 5.7.139Authentication unsuccessful,SmtpClientAuthentication is disabled for the Mailbox.Visit https://aka.ms/smtp_auth_disabled for more information. HResult: -2146233088. If Authenticated SMTP is already enabled, but your Entra ID Tenant has Security Defaults enabled, Publisher will still be unable to authenticate and show this error instead. An error occurred while sending the test mail: The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.7.57 Client not authenticated to send mail. Error: 535 5.7.139 Authentication unsuccessful, user is locked by your organization\u2019s security defaults policy. Contact your administrator. HResult: -2146233088. Please see kb: https://patchmypc.com/troubleshooting-smtp-email-sending Resolution To allow Publisher to send email reports through Exchange Online, you will need to configure an account to be allowed to authenticate using SMTP authentication and disable Security Defaults if enabled, following the steps outlined below Ensure your account is licenced to be a mailbox In the example below I am using Exchange Online (Plan 2), but there are alternative licences available. Enable SMTP authentication on your licenced mailbox Navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center and select Active Users \u2013Active users \u2013 Microsoft 365 admin center, Then select the mailbox you wish to configure, click on Mail, followed by Manage email apps.

Despite this announcement,Patch My PC customers are unaffected. WSUS will continue to be supported in its current state, and no action is required by our customers. This article explains the deprecation in more detail and reassures customers about its non-impact on their environments. Microsoft Announcement Microsoft announced the deprecation ofWindows Server Update Services (WSUS).Deprecation, in this context, means that Microsoft are no longer adding new features or accepting requests for them. However, existing functionality will remain, and updates will continue to be published through the WSUS channel. It has been confirmed that WSUS will still be available onWindows Server 2025and beyond. Importantly, there are also no current plans to remove the WSUS feature from existing supported Windows Server versions. You can read the announcement athttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-server-update-services-wsus-deprecation/ba-p/4250436 Patch My PC Resonse At Patch My PC, we understand that this notice from Microsoft may raise concerns with our customers.

Ourautomated email reportscan be helpful to keep you informed when third-party products are publishing. These emails contain a lot of useful details like release notes, update classification, severity levels, and CVE IDs, as shown below: If you can\u2019t send emails, the problem is almost always related to theSMTP server configuration. Here are common issues we see that we recommend checking: IncorrectSMTP Server details SMTPportandprotocol Verify allusernamesandpasswords Firewallsettings Step 1: Check Your Ports One of the most common issues we see is the ports defined aren\u2019t correct for the customer\u2019s SMTP server. By default, our service is configured to usePort 587andUse TLS. These are the default settings for many public email providers like Office 365, Outlook.com, and Gmail. If you are using aninternal SMTP server, it may be different such as the defaultPort 25,or it may not be configured forTLS. Step 2: Is Authentication Required? Another common issue is that your SMTP server may require authentication, but you didn\u2019t set theloginandpasswordfor aSpecified User. Step 3: Does Sending Work in the UI But Not During An Automated Sync? In some cases, you may be able to send a test email manually in our UI by clickingTest, but emails to send during a synchronization with errors in the PatchMyPC.log Generally, this is because your SMTP server allowsdomain accountsto send emails, but doesn\u2019t allow anonymous users to send. Since our settings tool UI is running under your local user context, it will enable the email to send. However, our service runssynchronizationsunder thelocal SYSTEM accountas a service that may not be allowed to send emails through your SMTP server. In this scenario, try to configure anauthentication accountby selectingSpecified Userand setting theLoginandPasswordfor that user: Step 4: Try Using A Common Provider? If sending is failing using an internal SMTP server, you can attempt to use a public email service. Click the drop-down menu and select your provider, if supported, we will pre-fill server, port, and TLS settings. You will need a valid email and password and ensure the outgoing ports aren\u2019t blocked. Step 5: Ask Your Email Team To Verify Settings and SMTP Logs If you have a dedicated team for email, we recommend having them review all the configurations within our tool. We Hope This Helped Resolve Your Issue Hopefully, this guide helped resolve your issue. Generally, we are going to be very limited in the support we can provide for SMTP emails as the sending is all performed on the SMTP server.

There are some scenarios where we need to change a default behavior to address specific customer issues/needs. These advanced settings are not available via the Publisher user-interface and canonly be set via RegValues. Enable the Delete Update Button in the Modify Updates Wizard The delete update button is not enabled by default because it can cause hash issues if an update is deleted while that product is still enabled, causing the same UpdateID to be republished. If you have a scenario to delete updates, such as cleaning upvendors from WSUSyou can enable the button using the value below. REG ADD \u201cHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Patch My PC Publishing Service\u201d /v EnableDeleteUpdates /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f Save Detection Method PowerShell Scripts to Custom Folder Based onUserVoice feedback, you can now save all PowerShell detection method scripts to a secondary folder location.

For extremely large environments, SQL queries against this view can be slower since it\u2019s not indexed. You can change the view to use the v_GS_INSTALLED_SOFTWARE for better performance since it is indexed. Note: this view will contain slightly different results since it\u2019sbased on asset intelligence. REG ADD \u201cHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Patch My PC Publishing Service\u201d /v UseGSINSTALLEDSOFTWARE /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f Change the SQL Timeout Period By default, the SQL timeout period for each product query is 90 seconds.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-use-process-monitor-help/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to use Process Monitor to help diagnose publishing issues In the following article we will show you how to use Process Monitor (procmon) from Sysinternals to collect file system, registry and process events to assist a Patch My PC support engineer with diagnosing publishing issues in both WSUS and ConfigMgr. Overview Sometimes we require more details to help diagnose publishing issues in your environment.Process Monitor, from Sysinternals, commonly referred to asProcmon, is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that captures real-time file system, registry and process activity. We often see antivirus engines locking files during publishing and a procmon trace is useful to help flag to security teams the correct antivirus configurations and exclusions to put into place. A procmon trace is also very useful at revealing competing antivirus products installed on the same server which will exasperate file locks. We often encounter this when customers perform in-place upgrades on servers from Server 2012 > higher. Windows Defender must be explicitly disabled or set to passive mode after an in-place upgrade if you are using a third-party antivirus solution. See the following advice from Microsoft for more informationMicrosoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server | Microsoft Learn Note:Please see the following KB for the recommended antivirus exclusions when publishing apps and updates to ConfigMgr, WSUS and IntunePatch My PC \u2013 Recommended antivirus exclusions Download Procmon from Sysinternals Procmon can either be downloaded as a zip file (1) or as an executable (2) from the Sysinternals website. Typically, we recommend downloading the zip file and extracting the contents to disk so they can be used for continuous troubleshooting when working with our engineers on a support case. Downloadthe zip file from thie websitehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmonor directly from this linkhttps://download.sysinternals.com/files/ProcessMonitor.zip.Once downloaded, extract the contents to a folder. The extracted zip file will reveal the following files which we will use for troubleshooting. Run a procmon trace to diagnose publishing issues Unless otherwise instructed, a procmon trace is run from the same computer where the Patch My PC Publishing Service is installed. 1. Runprocmon.exe(1) on the same computer where the Patch My PC Publisher Serviceis installed (2) 2. Agree to the Sysinternals licence terms 3. Procmon will start collecting events straight away. To avoid unnecessarily \u00e2\u0080\u008blarge capture files, stop the capture until you are ready to reproduce the issue. Stop the trace by clicking theCaptureicon on the toolbar. 4. Clear the current trace by clicking theClearicon on the taskbar. 5. Re-produce the publishing issue by selecting the appropriate products in the Publisher and from theSync Schedule(1) tab clickRun Publishing Service Sync(2). 6. Immediately, in procmon click theCaptureicon on the toolbar to begin capturing the publishing events that occur during the sync. 7. Once publishing has completed, click theCaptureicon on the toolbar again (see above) to finish the capture. You can verify the sync has completed by reviewing the following log file and observing the*** Reportlog line. This log line indicates the sync has completed and will report any success and failures. %PatchMyPCInstallDirectory%\\PatchMyPC.log 8. Save the capture by clickingSavefrom theFilemenu. 9. Unless instructed to filter captured events, ensure the following options are selected:- Events to save =All events Format =Native Process Monitor Format (PML) Path =Make a note of the path where the .pml file will be saved By default, the .pml file will save into the same folder that procmon.exe was launched from and will be namedLogFile.PML. 10. Finally, the .pml file will compress very well. Please compress the file before sending it to Patch My PC support. Send the capture (pml) file to Patch My PC support IMPORTANT:As well as sharing the capture with us, we also require the relevant log files to help us match failed publishing events with the captured events. Your support engineer will ask for the relevant log files, as listed in the KBCollecting Log Files to Send to Support for SCCM and Intune \u2013 Patch My PC. Even after compressing the .pml file, it is normally too large to send via email. Please upload the captured eventsandrequested log files, in .zip format. We recommend renaming the zip file so its descriptive and can easily identified by your support engineer.

Below we will cover what this actually means and why we think this program will benefit our customers. What is Proactive Customer Care? Our proactive customer care program is a way to help ensure ourPublishing softwareis running smoothly and successfully publishingthird-party updatesandapplicationsto Windows Server Updates Services (WSUS), Configuration Manager, orMicrosoft Intune. If we receiveinsightsthat key operations failed, such as publishing a third-party update to WSUS, we want to notify you and ensure things are running smoothly again as soon as possible. Why We Think It\u2019s Important From an engineering perspective, our biggest goal is for you to set our software up once, and thenit just works. Generally, this works great since everything is fully automated after setup, and day-to-day work is performed using yourexisting workflowsin the Configuration Manager console orIntune portal. If you enabled theSMTP email featureorMicrosoft Teams notificationsin our Publisher, as shown below, we would already notify you about anyhealth issues. Here\u2019s an exampleemail alertyou would receive if yourWSUSContent is misconfigured. Our goal with proactive customer care is to send alerts containing key information abouterrors in your environment,even if youdidn\u2019t enable emails using SMTP settingsdirectly in our software. We don\u2019t want customers to realize there are issues when they notice a new0-day vulnerabilityisn\u2019t showing up in their environment. Proactive Alerts for Optimizing Performance Starting in July 2021, we will also send alerts for settings that could allow you to optimize various configurations to avoid future problems. For example, in Configuration Manager 1806, there are new settings forsoftware update maintenancethat aren\u2019t enabled by default. If these settings aren\u2019t enabled, you could receive a proactive email to let you know this could help improve performance and reliability. How Does Proactive Customer Care Work? By partnering with our customer base of over 2,000, we have seentrendsandrecurring issuesthat lead to a list ofknowledge base articlesto solve known issues quickly. Last month, we included a newtelemetry optionto let us know if you receive any error messages during important publishing operations for updates and applications. If we detect aknown issuethrougherror insights, we will send you a direct email containing the information about how to resolve the issue.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/optimizing-azure-sentinel-log-ingestion/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Optimizing Azure Sentinel Log Ingestion for Intune Customers using the Defender XDR Connector Azure Sentinel is a powerful security information and event management (SIEM) platform, but as organizations scale, large amounts of data can quickly lead to high operational costs. For Intune customers using the Defender XDR Connector with Azure Sentinel, a common cause of excessive event ingestion is Win32 App Detection and Requirement scripts. These scripts are evaluated every 24 hours on each device for required apps. This frequent evaluation can lead to a significant increase in event volume, especially when targeting large numbers of devices with several hundred Intune Win32 app update policies. Determine if You are Affected TheDeviceProcessEventsand/or theDeviceFileEventstable can become noisy due to script executions by Intune Management Extension (IME). Specifically, events related to the execution of detection and requirement scripts. Win32 app detection and requirement scripts are all handled by the IME processAgentExecutor.exewhich, in turn, invokes powershell.exe. You may see excessive events when you run the following query agains theDeviceProcessEventstable. A useful KQL query to understand the extent of these invocations and recorded entries against the DeviceProcessEvents table can be found below. Note:This example data does not reflect the issue outlined in this KB. Workaround Azure Sentinel provides the ability to apply data transformations directly in the Log Analytics Workspace to customize data ingestion and processing. The following steps outline how to apply transformations to specific tables to exclude events related to the Intune Agent Executor. IMPORTANT Applying transformations to tables to exclude certain events may haveserious security implications. While transformations can help reduce noise and lower the cost of Azure Sentinel, they alsopermanently exclude data before it is ingested. Once excluded, the events areirrecoverable, which means they cannot be used forfuture analysis,threat hunting, orincident investigation. Ensure you carefully evaluate the impact of any exclusions, and consult with your security team before applying transformations. 1. Log in to the Azure Portal. 2. In the search bar at the top of the portal, typeLog Analytics workspacesand select it from the results. 3. From the list of workspaces, locate the Log Analytics Workspace associated with your Azure Sentinel instance. 4. From the left-hand menu, under Settings, click onTables. 5. Use the search bar to find theDeviceProcessEventstable. 6. Click on the ellipsis (\u2026) and selectCreate transformation. 7. SelectCreate a new data collection rule. 8. Select the desiredSubscriptionandResource Groupto create the data collection rule in. Enter aNamefor the rule and clickDone. 9. ClickNext. 10. ClickTransformation Editorand enter the following KQL query in the window. Ensure the queryRuns(copying and pasting from WordPress can result in incorrect ASCII chars being pasted) and then clickApply. 11. ClickNextand on the summary review screen, clickCreate. Note:You can find data collection rules used on table transformations by navigating toAgents > Data Collection Rulesfrom the Log Analytics workspace. NOTEWhile transformations themselves don\u2019t incur direct costs, some scenarios can result in additional charges, as per:-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-transformations#cost-for-transformations Fortunately, if Azure Sentinel is enabled for the Log Analytics workspace,there\u2019s no filtering ingestion charge regardless of how much data the transformation filters. Additional Event Savings If you are seeking additional savings, it might also be worth understanding if you can apply transformations to other tables. Specifically, montiroing whenthe IME creates detection scripts on disk might not be of value but it can result in large event data when targetting hundres or thousands of required apps to devices. DeviceFileEvents |where FolderPath !startswith \u201cC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft intune management extension\\content\\detectionscripts\u201d Summary Applying transformations to tables can effectively reduce costs by filtering out unnecessary events, such as those generated by the Intune Management Extension (IME), which can be excessively chatty when evaluating scripts for required Win32 apps. These transformations permanently exclude the filtered events before ingestion, making them unavailable for future analysis or investigation. To avoid unintentionally filtering out critical security data, it is essential to thoroughly test and understand the transformation\u2019s impact before applying it. Always consult with your security team to ensure that the exclusion does not adversely affect security monitoring or compromise your business compliance requirements.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/pmpc-app-detection-troubleshooting/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Troubleshooting Patch My PC Application Detection Troubleshooting Patch My PC Application Detection In this article, we will detail how to troubleshoot the scripts that are generated by the Patch My PC Publisher. These scripts are created for the purposes of application detection (both Intune, and ConfigMgr applications) as well as Intune update requirement scripts. Topicscovered in this article: Local Copy of PowerShell Scripts Troubleshooting ConfigMgr Scripts Topic3 Topic4 Topic5 Topic6 Local Copy of PowerShell Scripts When the Publisher processes software, it retains a copy of the PowerShell scripts that are generated. These copies can be found in the installation directory of the Publisher in subfolders as shown below. The names of the scripts will match the application name, version, and architecture making it easy to identify which one is needed for troubleshooting. For example if you install the Publisher in the default location on the C: drive you would find scripts in the folders described below. Root FolderC:\\Program Files\\Patch My PCPatch My PC Publisher Service Detection Method ScriptsScripts generated for detecting Configuration Manager applications Scripts generated for detecting Configuration Manager applications Detection Method Scripts for IntuneScripts generated for detecting Intune Win32 applications Scripts generated for detecting Intune Win32 applications Detection Method Scripts for Intune UpdatesScripts generated for both detection, and requirements for Intune Win32 updates Scripts generated for both detection, and requirements for Intune Win32 updates If troubleshooting a particular application installation, the respective script can be copied from these directories. Troubleshooting ConfigMgr Scripts To troubleshoot the scripts for Configuration Manager applications, we will want tograb a copy of the generated scriptfor the respective applications. For this example, we will run through the detection of \u2018Zoom Meetings 5.4.58740.1105\u2018 Troubleshooting steps: Get a Copy of Detection Script Validate Code Signing Certificate Trust If ApplicableCheck Client Settings Execution Policy Check Client Settings Execution Policy Run Script On Client Run Script On Client In Verbose Mode Evaluate Patch My PC Log File Evaluate Configuration Manager Log Files Collect Uninstall Registry Hives for Support Get a Copy of Detection Script Reference thebeginning of this articleto find the location of your Configuration Manager application detection scripts. I have located the generated script on my machine that runs the Patch My PC Publisher for Zoom Meetings. The example path is below. \u201cC:\\Program Files\\Patch My PCPatch My PC Publishing ServiceDetection Method ScriptsZoom Meetings 5.4.58740.1105.ps1\u201d This file can be copied to the client device we intend to do troubleshooting on. Validate Code Signing Certificate Trust If Applicable In this case, thescript is signedbased on myoptions in the Publisher. If the scripts are being signed, then you\u2019ll need to verify the trust relationship. If they arenot signed, you\u2019ll still want toverify the execution policy configured in your Client Settings. This code signing happens with the configuredWSUS Signing Certificate. With the script beingsigned, we will want to validate that theclients trust the code signing certificateandcheck the code signing configurationwithin the Configuration Manager Client Settings. An example of validating the client trusting the certificate is below used to sign the script is below. This is a copy of the signed script generated by the publisher. It should be copied directly from the directories described above to ensure the code signing is still valid.Do not copy-paste the script from the Detection Method in Configuration Manageras this may add or remove characters, invalidating the code signing. We can additionally validate this is thesame certificate in use by the Publisher. Certificate trust relies on the code signing certificate being in the \u2018Trusted Publishers\u2018 certificate store, and also having a validcertificate chainfor trust. There are two scenarios for certificate chain trust with a code-signing certificate. If the code signing certificate isself-signedthe trust will rely on thecode-signing certificate being in the Trusted Root Certificate Authoritiescertificate store. If this is apki-basedcode-signing certificate, or from apublic certificate authoritythen the certificate should already be trusted in your environment, as thecertificate chain would be trusted already, and you would only need to ensure the code-signing certificate is in the \u2018Trusted Publishers\u2018 certificate store unless you find it is not trusted for some reason. In either case, you should find the certificate in the respective stores similar to the below screenshot. With the certificate in the correct stores, the certificate should be trusted and valid. Check Client Settings Execution Policy Once we understand whether our detection scripts are being signed, and if we trust the signing certificate on our client, we can determine oureffective execution policyfor our client we are troubleshooting. I have found the client in theConfiguration Manager Console, right-clicked it, and selected \u2018Resultant Client Settings\u2018 Navigate to:Computer Agent > PowerShell execution policyandtake note of the value. We will use this when weexecute our script on a client for testing. Run Script On Client When a Configuration Manager application detection method runs we do have some visibility into what happens. TheAppDiscovery.logand theAppIntentEval.logcan be used to evaluate exit codes and the resolved intent of application discovery. But, because we have a copy of the detection script it is good to do some testing byrunning the script manually. A detection script can run inboththeuser contextand thesystem contextdepending on how the installation was started. For the Patch My PC script, testing in user context is sufficient. In the below screenshot we have copied our script,Zoom Meetings 5.4.58740.1105.ps1, to the desktop of the client we are testing on. A PowerShell window is opened. It does not need to be elevatedunless you need to elevate to set the execution policy. Note that we use theSet-ExecutionPolicycmdlet in order to match the policy we previously found in theResultant Client Settings. In my case, I am setting it toRemoteSignedand also specify a \u2018Scope\u2019 ofProcessto ensure this is a temporary setting change. With this in place, I have executed the script & \u2018.Zoom Meetings 5.4.58740.1105.ps1\u2019 The expected output of this script is \u2018Detected\u2018 and that is not what we are seeing on this client. This explains why this device would not detect this application from a Configuration Manager deployment. Run Script On Client In Verbose Mode The Configuration Manager detection script has a-verboseparameter that will make it much more informational. This includes bothclient output being verbose, as well as the log file having additional entries. & \u2018.Zoom Meetings 5.4.58740.1105.ps1\u2019 -verbose Note: The -verbose option was added in Version 2.0 of the script. You can open the script and check the release notes, or $ScriptVersion variable to see the version. Configuration Manager detection scripts can also be recreated using theRecreate Detection Script right-click option. The version is also noted in the log file generated by the script. Evaluate Patch My PC Log File The log file for Configuration Manager application detection is calledPatchMyPC-SoftwareDetectionScript.logand it can be located in one oftwo locationsdepending on the context the script was run under. Script ran as user(When testing script, or if the user clicks \u2018Install\u2019 in Software Center)Temp directory of the user that ran the scriptVariable%temp%(cmd/File Explorer) or$env:temp(PowerShell) Temp directory of the user that ran the script Variable%temp%(cmd/File Explorer) or$env:temp(PowerShell) Script run as system(Script runs as part of required application deployment, or you run as system deliberately for testing)This is typicallyC:\\Windows\\CCM\\Logsbut the script does use the below registry value to get the exact value for the log path.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftCCMLogging@Global > LogDirectory This is typicallyC:\\Windows\\CCM\\Logsbut the script does use the below registry value to get the exact value for the log path. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftCCMLogging@Global > LogDirectory Below is a sample log file from a verbose run of the detection script. We can see that both theSoftware, andSoftwareWOW6432Nodewere searched in this case, and no match was found forZoomwithversion 5.4.58740.1105. With no matches found, we can either manually navigate the registry hives, and try to identify why the software is not found, or we can run the script provided below to collect a CSV file which can be easier to navigate. Collect Uninstall Registry Hives for Support If you are unable to determine the cause of the issue, or if requested by Patch My PC support,this scriptcan be used to generate a CSV file containing all the uninstall registry hives. Below you will find an example of using the script. For the below example,the scripthas been copied to a file Export-PMPCUninstallRegistryHives.ps1 in the C:\\temp directory. The file is thendot-sourcedto load the function so it can be run. You may need to set your execution policy. The script will generate aPMPC-Uninstall-Hive-Export.csvin the same directory the script is by default. In the below screenshot I have simply imported the CSV to show some sample data. You wouldPMPC-Uninstall-Hive-Export.csvPMPC-Uninstall-Hive-Export.csv. In the case of our missing Zoom install, I can either open the CSV in Excel or something similar, or I can search the CSV with PowerShell as shown below. And we do see that Zoom was found, BUT it isunder the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive. This is a common issue for software that supports user based installs.

These are options that apply specifically to the applications created in Configuration Manager. Below is a screenshot of this section as of the writing of this article. Allow applications to be installed from the Install Application task sequence action When this option is checked every application created by the Publisher will have the equivalent checkbox displayed below checked in Configuration Manager. If you intend to use the applications as part of any Task Sequences, you will want to check this option. Allow clients to use distribution points from the site\u2019s default boundary group When this option is checked every application deployment type created by the Publisher will have the equivalent checkbox displayed below checked in Configuration Manager. Whether you select this option is a company-specific decision based on your network layout and bandwidth considerations. Seethis Microsoft docs linkfor more information around the content options for applications. Code-sign the PowerShell detection method script using the WSUS Signing Certificate. When this option is checked every application created by the Publisher will have a code-signed PowerShell detection script. Because there is already a code-signing certificate in place for Third Party Patching, and all clients trust it, we are able to leverage this to sign the detection scripts generated by the Publisher. Generally, code-signing is used to ensure the integrity of the script being run. For more information regarding code-signing seethis linkandthis linkwhich discusses the how and why in further detail. When you do sign the detection scripts, you\u2019ll see a large block of text at the end of the script as shown below. Do not include the version in the application name, so the application name doesn\u2019t change after updates. When this option is checked newly created applications will no longer have the version number as part of the application name. There are some use cases that benefit from this, such as MDT UDI, UI++, or anything that is keying specifically off the application name. Below you can see the result of having this boxunchecked.The name of the application will be different every time a new one is published, reflecting the current version. And the below shows the result of having this boxchecked, which removes the versioning. This results in a consistent name between application versions. If you wish to control this on a per-application basis you can referencethis article.It will show some of the additional options regarding application naming that are available within the right-click context menu. Note:TheLATESTversion of the application will not have the version appended to the name. However, if you are retaining any older version of the app, their version will be re-appended to the name. Move applications to the following folder in the applications node of the console. When this option is checked every application created by the Publisher will be moved to the specified folder in the Applications node in the console. In the screenshot below we can see the \u2018ApplicationsPatch My PC\u2019 folder is in use.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/managing-enrollment-status-pages-microsoft/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Managing Enrollment Status Pages in Microsoft Intune In this article, we will discuss how Patch My PC can manage the Intune Win32 applications which are associated withEnrollment Status Pages. Note:This feature will require your Azure App Registration to haveDeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.Allpermissions set. Why Use Enrollment Status Pages An Enrollment Status Page (ESP) allows you to configure a list of applications thatmust be installed before the ESP completes. This is particularly useful if you happen to be using theIntune Updates featureof the Patch My PC Publisher. Generally, Intune Updates are assigned toall devicesor alarge number of devicesasrequired. With this large scope of a required assignment, you would see the Intune Updates be evaluated during Autopilot or Device Enrollment. To prevent these updates from unnecessarily evaluating, you canspecify a list of applications in your ESP. Below is a sample of what an ESP might look like in the Intune portal. These are found within Intune under Home > Devices > Windows > Enrollment Status Page. Note:You shouldn\u2019t associate Intune Updates from the Patch My PC Publisher with an Enrollment Status Page. The updates have a \u2018Requirement\u2019 script that checks if an old version of the application is installed. This is almost never going to apply during Autopilot or Device Enrollment. Update ESP When New Application Version Published Within theIntune Options, there is an option to \u2018Update Enrollment Status Page associations with new application when an updated application is created.\u2019 This option can be seen below. This option will ensure that the list of selected Win32 applications for an IntuneEnrollment Status Pageiskept up to date as new versions of applications are published. These Enrollment Status Pages are commonly used during Autopilot. With this checkbox checked the Publisher will ensure the latest version of the published application is associated with your ESP during a synchronization. Right-Click Option to Assign ESP The \u2018Manage ESP Profiles\u2019 right-click option allows you to manage theEnrollment Status Page profileswhich any Win32 application can be associated with (Intune Apps). The ESPs are pulled from Microsoft Intune for your configured tenant. Note that the profile must have \u2018Show app and profile configuration progress\u2018 set to \u2018Yes\u2018 in order to appear in the list for selection. An example list is shown below. Any Win32 applicationcreated by the publisherwill beadded to the ESPs which are selectedfor the respective application. Note:ESP associations will beaddedto existing applications during the next publisher sync, but theywill not be removedfor existing applications.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/prevent-required-intune-app-from/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Prevent a required Intune app from installing if any version of the app is already installed In some situations, such as during Autopilot deployments, you may need to mark a Patch My PCIntune appasrequiredto ensure it installs during the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) phase, when blocking apps are enforced. However, after the app is installed, you might want to prevent that required targeting from pushing newer versions of the app to the device. Instead, you can use Patch My PCIntune updatesto manage future updates using update rings. This approach lets you control the update cadence, avoiding the immediate updates that would otherwise happen due to the original required targeting. In this article, we\u2019ll guide you through configuring an extra requirement on Patch My PCIntune appsto prevent immediate app updates after the initial installation has occured. Scenario 1 Install a required app during Autopilot but prevent the same, required, assignment from updating the app when a new version is published by Patch My PC. In deployment scenarios like Autopilot, it\u2019s common to designate apps asrequiredto ensure they install during the ESP phase. This ensures that critical applications are in place before the device is handed over to the user. However, a challenge typically arises after the initial installation \u2013 the samerequiredassignment that ensured the app was deployed can also triggerimmediateupdates when a newer version of the app becomes available. This behavior can be problematic for organizations that want to control when app updates are applied, especially when users need stability and consistency on their devices. Why does this occur? The issue arises because Patch My PC creates the initial version of the app usingIntune apps, and admins will assign it asrequiredtoAll Devices(for example) for deployment. This ensure\u2019s the app gets installed during Autopilot when using the ESP blocking apps feature. When a new version of the app is released by the vendor, Patch My PC automatically creates and publishes the updated version while retaining the same assignments as the initial release. This means that the new version is immediately targeted to the same devices with a required assignment, resulting in the app being pushed as soon as it\u2019s available. Why is this a problem? This breaks any expected ringed update approach when customers have deployed Patch My PCIntune updates, where organizations typically want to stagger updates through phased deployments, ensuring stability and controlled testing before the app reaches all users. This behavior can lead to the new version being deployed too quickly, bypassing the gradual rollout process many customers expect. Scenario 2 Install a required app for a specific set of users or devices but prevent the same, required, assignment from updating the app when a new version is published. In many deployment scenarios, admins may choose to assign an app as required for specific users or devices to ensure it is deployed automatically. This approach ensures that critical applications are installed for a targeted group, ensuring those users or devices have the necessary apps to perform their job function. However, a challenge often arises after the initial installation \u2013 the same required assignment that ensured the app was deployed to the intended group can also trigger an immediate update when a newer version of the app is released by the vendor. This behavior can be problematic for organizations looking to maintain control over when app updates are applied. The issue occurs because Patch My PC creates the initial version of the app usingIntune apps, and admins often assign it as required for specific users or devices. This guarantees the app is installed across the specified group. When a new version of the app is released by the vendor, Patch My PC automatically generates and publishes the updated version while retaining the same assignments that were set for the initial release. As a result, the new version is immediately targeted to those same users or devices, leading to an immediate update. This disrupts any desired phased update strategy, particularly when Patch My PCIntune updatesare in place. Organizations typically want to roll out updates gradually, ensuring that testing is performed and stability is maintained before the app reaches all users or devices. However, this behavior can result in updates being deployed too quickly, bypassing the carefully planned rollout process. Customers expecting to manage updates using rings or controlled phases may find their users or devices receiving updates sooner than anticipated, potentially introducing instability or unforeseen issues within their environments. Solution Step 1: Download and edit the Get-NotInstalledRequirement.ps1 script The provided script will be used as a requirement check for a Win32 app in Intune, designed to evaluate if specific software is already installed on a device. The script performs the following:- Checks for Installed ApplicationsThe script looks for installed applications by searching the Windows registry for specific software titles listed in the$appNameListarray. In the provided example in the script, it searches for \u2018Cisco Secure Client\u2019 and \u2018Cisco AnyConnect\u2019 by their \u201cApps & Features\u201d DisplayName. Registry SearchIt examines the registry paths related to both 32-bit (Wow6432Node) and 64-bit installations, depending on the device architecture, to check for installed applications. It scans the registry hives (HKLM and HKCU) for the software names. Custom MatchingThe script performs a pattern match (using -like) to find software that matches the names in$appNameList. If a match is found, the script does not return any output, which means the requirement is not met, preventing the Win32 app from installing. Determines ApplicabilityIf the specified software is found, the script outputsApplicable. This indicates that the software is not installed, satisfying the requirement for the Win32 app to be installed on the device. 1. Download the script fromhttps://github.com/PatchMyPCTeam/Community-Scripts/blob/main/Install/NotInstalledRequirement/Get-NotInstalledRequirement.ps1 2. Open the script in VSCode, Notepad or another text editor of your choice. 3. Replace the contents of the array list$appNameListonline 36with theApps & Features / Installed Appsname of the app you want to check for. Note:The script will search for the exact match based on what you enter in $appNameList. You can add asterisk characters (*) if you want to use wildcards. For example:$appNameList = @(\u20187-Zip*2*\u2019)will match a DisplayName of7-Zip 24.07 (x64) Important:Using an overly generic name may cause the app to be falsely detected as installed. In the following example, we replace the default entries in the$appNameListarray with\u2018Google Chrome\u2019as this is the DisplayName that is shown inApps & Features / Installed Appswhen this app is installed. 4. Save the script. Step 2: Select your Publishing Method The app must be publishedbeforewe can add the requirement script in the Intune Admin Center. Patch My PC Publisher In the following example, we will use Google Chrome:- 1. Open the Patch My PC Publisher. 2. Navigate to the Intune apps tab and clickoptions(the options button might look different than depicted in the image below depending on your licence level). 2. Ensure the check box is selected forCopy the requirements from previously created applications or updates when an updated application is created 3. Ensure your desired variant ofGoogle Chromeis selected with the intent to Publish by verifying the check box is ticked on the Intune apps tab. 4. After the next schedule sync cycle, or a manual sync, or as a result from being published previously, find your selected variant of Google Chrome in the Intune Admin Center. 5. Proceed toStep 3. Patch My PC Cloud In the following example, we will use Google Chrome:- 1. In a browser, navigate tohttps://portal.patchmypc.com. 2. By reviewing theDeploymentstab, ensure the app is already deployed. If it is not,follow the instructions hereto deploy an Intune app from Patch My PC Cloud. 3. Proceed toStep 3. Step 3: Add the requirement script to the app in the Intune Admin Center To address the issue where new versions of required Patch My PC apps continue to install immediately on targeted Entra ID groups after the initial deployment, arequirement scriptcan be implemented. This solution leverages the ability to add custom requirements to Win32 apps in Intune, ensuring that if the app is already installed, a newer version of the Intune app will not install, regardless of a required assignment. By using a requirement, the script checks ifanyversion of the app is already present on the device, and if so, it marks the Win32 app asnot applicable. This prevents the immediate install behavior triggered by the required assignment. In the following example, we will continue to use Google Chrome:- 1. Select the app in the Intune Admin Centre. In our example, we are usingGoogle Chrome. 2. SelectPropertiesand clickEditin the app requirements section. 3. ClickAdd. 4. Select the Requirement typeScript. 5. Select the edited script you saved inStep 1and apply the following settings:- Script file:Get-NotInstalledRequirement.ps1 Run script as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients:No Run this script using the logged on crednetials:No(Unless you are deploying an app that installs in the User context, then set this toYes). Enforce script signature check:No Select output data type:String Operator:Equals Value:Applicable 6. ClickOK. 7. ClickReview & Savetwice and clickSave. 8. The Win32 app should indicate that it now has the requirement script configured. Step 4: Verify a newer version of a required Intune app will not install if an older version of the application is already installed In the following example,Google Chrome 114.0.5735.199is already installed on the device. We can simulate a required deployment of a newer version of the Intune app. We deployedGoogle Chrome 130.0.6723.59, as an Intune app. In the Company Portal we can verify the newer version of the Intune app did not install, it is marked asRequirements not met. The AppWorkload.log also indicates the applicability result: ScriptRequirementRuleNotMet =1008(0x000003F0). The AppActionProcessor.log also indicates the Intune app is not applicable. Summary By utilizing the script in this article as a requirement for Patch My PC Intune apps, the installation of newer versions of the app can be blocked if an older version of the app is already installed on a device. The script checks the system for the app and, if found, marks the app as \u201cnot applicable,\u201d ensuring the required assignment does not trigger an immediate, unplanned, update of the app. Crucially, this approach does not interfere with Intune updates managed by Patch My PC. Once the app is installed, Patch My PC Intune updates will continue to work as expected, allowing you to control when updates are deployed. This gives you the flexibility to maintain controlled rollouts, like during Autopilot, while ensuring an expected cadence of update roll-out across your organisation.

Cause The error code0x80070642typically means that the app installation was cancelled / snoozed by the user from the pop-up generated by the Patch My PCManage Conflicting Processesfeature. Example scenario and repro steps Products that should be closed while an update is being applied can be found atKnown Issues and Considerations when Using Patch My PC \u2013 Patch My PC.We will be using the Notepad++ application in the following example, because we know this is an application that must be closed for it to successsfully install.Scenario:An update to this app was published from Patch My PC Publisher to Intune, and based on the assignment, it gets deployed to your client devices. However, out of the 300 targeted devices, 100 devices failed to install the update and returned error : The user cancelled the app installation (0x80070642), in the Intune Admin Center under \u201cDevice Install Status\u201d.Repro steps: Navigate to the \u201cIntune Updates\u201d tab in the Publisher. Select Notepad++ (x64). Right click the product and select \u201cManage Conflicting Process\u201d. Note:By default, if you see thexicon next to any app, it indicates that the app must be closed before an update can be installed. This implies that Managed Conflicting Process (MCP) feature needs to be configured for this product. The default behavior for these apps is set toSkip Installation when conflicting process are in use. With this option set and un-changed, the update will install successfully if the application is closed, but it will fail if the app remains open, and it will fail with exit code 1618.https://patchmypc.com/patchmypc-scriptrunner-known-exit-codes. Note:Applications that should be clsoed during an update behave differently when this default setting is enabled.For instance, with Notepad++, the \u201cAdd and Remove\u201d program entry in the Control Panel will be updated, but the Notepad++ binary on disk will not be updated. If you\u2019ve configured the customization to \u201cNotify the user to close the app\u201d and set a specific number for deferrals, the behavior will vary accordingly. If this customization is enabled, allowing users to defer the installation, then when a user selects the Snooze button, Intune will mark the update as \u201cThe user cancelled the app installation,\u201d leading to an error in the Intune portal. You can customize the behavior when the application is running. For instance, you can trigger a notification asking the user for permission to close the app so the update can proceed successfully. For more detailed guidance, please refer to our comprehensive Knowledge Base article atManage Conflicting Processes when Updating Third-Party Applications \u2013 Patch My PC. According to the settings above, the user can snooze the update up to 5 times. After the 5th time, there will be one more pop-up and that is when the coutdown will reach 0 and the app will be closed automatically and the update will be installed. Client side behavior In the following scenario, Notepad++ was running and when the update was initiated by the Intune Management Extension (IME), the user received a notification configured via the \u201cManage Conflicting Process\u201d to close the app. 1. IME processes the policy. 2. User selects \u201cSnooze Update\u201d. 3. IME reports installation failed 4. Error reported in the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner.log.

For instance, a notification can prompt the user to confirm whether it\u2019s acceptable to close the app for a successful update. If you use the Manage Conflicting Process feature in Patch My PC, and users choose to defer an update, the exit code of the installation will always be reported back to the Intune service. Intune will consider a 0 exit code as success but Patch My PC cannot manipulate or control how the Intune service interprets other exit codes. Tip:If you do allow users to postpone the install, don\u2019t allow them to postpone indefinitely or the app may never get updated. Note:After making any changes to the MCP configuration, you must re-publish the app or update so the latest modifications are incorporated into the existing package in Intune.

Determine if You are Affected If you are affected by this error, you will see errors similar to the errors below in thePatchMyPC.log,SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.log, orSoftwareDistribution.log. The actual log file you see the error in may vary depending on thePublishing methodyou are using. An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Verification of file signature failed for file: ServerUpdateServicesPackagesUpdate-ID.cab PublishPackage(): Operation Failed with Error: Verification of file signature failed for file: ServerUpdateServicesPackagesUpdate-ID.cab SyncUpdate: Exception Message: Verification of file signature failed for file: ServerUpdateServicesPackagesUpdate-ID.cab Is the File Signature Failed Error Happening when Publishing New Updates? There are two common scenarios where this error could occur. The first is whenpublishing a new update to WSUS,and the second is whenrevising an already published update. If using thePatch My PC Publisher, you should see the following in thePatchMyPC.logbefore the signature validation error: If using thein-console third-party catalog feature in SCCM, you should see the following line in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.logto confirm a new update fails to publish: If the error occurs when publishing a new update to WSUS, theWSUS Signing Certificateis notproperly installedin theTrusted RootorTrusted Publisherscertificate store on the WSUS Server. Next, you need to determine thethumbprintof theWSUS Signing Certificate. If using the Publisher, you can click theShow Certificatein theGeneraltab and take note ofthumbprint. If you are using the SCCM in-console publishing or any other method, you can opencertlm.mscand navigate to theWSUScertificate store. If you double click the certificate, you can review the thumbprint in theDetailstab. Once the WSUS Signing Certificate is identified, you need to ensure it\u2019s added to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publishercertificate store on the WSUS server. Opencertlm.mscand review theCertification Pathtab of the WSUS certificate. You may notice an error in this tab about thecertificate not being trusted. Next, you need to ensure the certificate exists on both theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store. In the WSUS certificate store,right-clickthe certificate and clickCopy. In theTrusted Publishersstore, right-click and clickPaste: Validate the certificate was copied to theTrusted Publishers store. If you receive a message, the certificate already exists you can clickYesto overwrite the existing certificate. Repeat the same process toPastethe WSUS Signing Certificate into theTrusted Rootcertificate store. The WSUS certificate should now be trusted on the WSUS server, and you can attempt topublish the update again. Note:Although manually copying the WSUS signing certificate to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publishersis a quick fix for the WSUS server, ideally, the WSUS signing certificate shouldautomatically be deployed to all machines,including the WSUS server. Is the File Signature Failed Error Happening when Revising Existing Updates? The error can also occur when an update already published to WSUS is attempting to berevised. In thePatchMyPC.log, you will see the following line before the error if it\u2019s being revised: If the.CABfile for the update referred to in the error exists. You will want to review the certificate used to sign it in thePropertiesof the file. You will need torepeat the steps in the previous sectionto ensure the certificate for the previously published update exist in theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store on the WSUS server. If the cab file doesn\u2019t exist in theUpdateServicesPackagesfolder, this means the file was likely removed during aWSUS cleanup task,or theWSUS contentfolder may have beenmovedwithout copying old updates. Whenever anupdate is revised(a command line change is one example when this may happen), the WSUS API needs access to the originally published CAB file in theUpdateServicesPackagesfolder. If this file doesn\u2019t exist, you will always receive the error: \u201cVerification of file signature failed for file:\u201c. If you are unable to restore the CAB file in theUpdateServicesPackagesfrom a backup, the only other workaround is torepublish the updates for the product as a new updateand supersede the current update that is unable to be revised during the republishing confirmation prompt.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/troubleshooting-incorrect-notifications-company-portal/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Troubleshooting Incorrect Notifications in the Company Portal App The Company Portal app communicates with Microsoft Intune using an IME (Intune Management Extension) bridge to manage app deployments and status reporting. When a user initiates actions like installing or uninstalling an app through the Company Portal, the app triggers calls to the Intune service to request app status updates based on both the User GUID and Device GUID. This setup enables the Company Portal to align the app\u2019s displayed status with Intune\u2019s reported state. Sometimes, the Company Portal doesn\u2019t always reflect the real-time state of the apps on the device accurately for the logged in user. Determine if You are Affected You will see that the Notifications displayed in the Company Portal app do not reflect the status of the apps in the Intune Admin Centre. In this example, we only see2app related issues being notified (the other errors shown are related to device compliance for other devices belonging to the user). But our expectation is there should be more. In your case, you might be expecting fewer, or no errors in the Company Portal at all. We can see there are8related app install issues for this device. Workaround The Company Portal periodically requests updated app status reports from the Intune service after each action (e.g. install, uninstall). It tracks the app status by requesting reports for the Intune enrolled device. However, the notifications shown in the Company Portal do not always match the actual state of applications on the device. This discrepancy is largley due to stale Win32 app reporting data cached in the user profile for the Company Portal. Deleting a specific JSON files in the user\u2019s profile proves an effective workaround to the problem. This action forces the Company Portal to re-query Intune for updated app status data the next time it is launched, resulting in a more accurate display of the app states. The JSON file is located here for each user profile on the device: Deletethe fileWin32LocalAppStatus.jsonandre-openthe Company Portal. The Company Portal should now show the correct notifications. In this example, it is displaying more errors \u2013 which is expected for this device. Note:Since the Company Portal tracking and reporting functions are proprietary to Microsoft Intune, the underlying processes remain outside direct control of Patch My PC. If this issue persists, consider logging a support case with Microsoft.

Determine if You are Affected Forsoftware updates failing to download, you may see the below error in theUpdatesHandler.log: CDeploymentJob \u2014 Failed to download update (121de25b-8ca6-4e50-8a81-b6baf31d9e5d). Error = 0x87d00669 If your software updates are visible in the software center, you may see theStatus columnstuck atPreparing to download If thesoftware updatedownload times out, you will see the following error:The software change returned error code 0x87D00669(-2016410007). If it\u2019s anapplicationfailing to download, you may see the below warning in theCIDownloader.log: ECCIInfo::SetError \u2013 Setting CI level error to (0x87d00607). If the error is for anapplicationand not a software update, the error will be:The software change returned error code 0x87D00607(-2016410105). Troubleshooting Step 1: Validate the Content is Successfully Distributed We see a common issue for clients not to download content because the content isnot distributedor thecontent fails to distribute. Forsoftware updates failing to download, perform the following actions: Software Library>Software Updates>Deployment Packages> Select theDeployment Packagethe updates is downloaded to: Here is an example of a deployment package in afailed state.If a package failed to distribute, clients would be unable to download the content. If the package is in a failed state, you can use the following resource to resolve the issue:Troubleshoot Content Distribution issues \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Docs. Below is an example of adeployment package that is not distributedto any distribution points. This scenario will also cause clients to be unable to download updates until youdistribute the content. Forapplications failing to download, perform the following actions: Software Library>Application Management>Applications>Select the Applications>Summary tab Validate the application content is successfully distributed and not in afailed or undistributed state. If the content is successfully distributed and you still have issues, please continue the next troubleshooting step. Tip:There isno direct way within the Configuration Manager console to view the deployment package(s) a specific software update is a part of. You will need to right-click the deployment package and click view members to review if the update in question is part of the package. If you have many deployment packages and updates, you can run the followingSQL queryto see the packages every update is a part of. Troubleshooting Step 2: Check if Client is in Boundary Groups The next troubleshooting step if the content is distributed is to validate a machine failing to download the content iswithin aboundary group. Since ConfigMgr 2002, the easiest way to check if a client falls within a boundary group is to perform the following actions: Assets and Compliance>Overview>Devices Right-click on one of the columns and add theBoundary Group(s)column. The example below shows that DEMO1CLIENT iswithin a boundary group, but DEMO1 isnot within a boundary group. After validating a client falls within a boundary group, you will want to perform the following steps tovalidate there is a distribution point site system referencedwithin thatboundary group: Note:Theboundary group(s) columnwas added in Configuration Manager 2002. Both the Configuration Manager server and client need to be upgraded to 2002 for this feature to work. The client version for 2002 is5.00.8968.1008 Troubleshooting Step 3: Validate Content is Distributed to Correct Distribution Point(s) If you are still having issues after the previous 2 steps, you should confirm the content is actually distributed to aspecific distribution pointin a boundary group from step 2. Perform the following steps to check the specific distribution points a software update deployment package is successfully distributed to: Monitoring\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082 >Distribution Status>Content Status > Select the deployment package Right-click on one of the columns and add theBoundary Group(s)column. Under theSuccesstab, ensure the content has been successfully distributed to aspecific distribution pointreferenced in the boundary groupfrom the previous step. Important:If the content isn\u2019t distributed to areferenced distribution pointof aclient\u2019s boundary group, you can right-click the item and choose toDistribute Content. Optional Additional Resources for Advanced Scenarios You can run the following SQL query to determine what deployment packages software updates are available. \u2014 Run this query against your ConfigMgr database to seeall software updatesand the deployment package they are part of. If you want to limit the software updates toonly Patch My PC third-party updates, you can run the following query instead. \u2014 Run this query against your ConfigMgr database to seeonly Patch My PC third-party software updatesand the deployment package they are part of.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/digest-verification-failed/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Digest Verification Failed on Content for Software Update The errorDigest verification failed on content for software updateis pretty common, In this article, we will review why file digest verification failures happen and how they are resolved. Determine if You are Affected by this Error If usingPatch My PC\u2019s Publisher, you will see an error similar to the one shown below in thePatchMyPC.log: The hash of file downloaded is different than the file hash in our catalog. Hash errors happen when vendors release updates that aren\u2019t available in our catalog yet. This error should be resolved in the next catalog update. Additional details: Downloaded Hash Catalog Hash If you are using theSCCM 1806+third-party updatesfeature directly in the SCCM console, you will see the following errors in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.logwhich is located on the top-level software update point in the site system logs folder. STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_HASH_FAIL). STATMSG: (SRVMSG_SMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT_UPDATECONTENT_FAIL). If you are using Microsoft\u2019s legacy method for publishing updates throughSystem Center Updates Publisher,you will see an error similar to the error below in theUpdatesPublishing.logorSCUP.loglocated in your users%temp%directory. \u2014 Digest verification failed on content for software update \u2018Google Chrome 72.0.3626.119 (x64) (UpdateId:\u2019626b77a4-61e5-4e84-9870-3aa68abafd0e\u2019 Vendor:\u2019Patch My PC\u2019 Product:\u2019SCUP Updates\u2019)\u2019. Why Does the Digest Verification Fail When Publishing Updates? Whenever a third-party update is being published with full-content, the update needs to passsecurity validation checks. The first check is that thebinary downloaded from the vendor\u2019s websitemustmatch the binary file digest when we created it. When vendors use thesame download URLfor a product such as Google Chrome:https://dl.google.com/chrome/install/GoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msi, hash validations can fail if you arepublishing an older version of the updateor if thevendor just released a new updatethat isn\u2019t in our catalog yet. Resolving Digest Verification Failures To fix the digest validation error, you will need toimportorsyncthe latest Patch My PC Update Catalog so you can publishthe latest software updatethat will match the hash of the vendor\u2019s latest update binary. You will need toperform a sync of the catalog manually. In the Third-Party Software Update Catalog node in your SCCM console, right-click the Patch My PC Catalog and chooseSync now. By default, SCCM will onlyautomatically sync a third-party software update catalog every 7 days. You can review the catalog sync progress in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.log. located on the top-level software update point in the site system logs folder. Once the catalog publishing sync is complete, you canperform a sync of your software update pointto have any newly released third-party updates show up in the \u201cAll Software Updates\u201d node of the SCCM console. Once the sync is complete, you should seenew updatesfor the product, and theprevious updates that were failing should become superseded. The latest version of the update should be able to publish the update content successfully. You will need to import the latest catalog manually from the console: Once the newest catalog is imported, you should seethe latest update(s)for the product that was previously failing to publish. Choose to publish the latest software updates(s). Our publisher always downloads thelatest catalogbefore any publishing operations. If you receive a hash error while using our publisher, it means the vendor recentlyreleased an update that isn\u2019t yet available in our catalog. You will just need to wait for future catalog syncs for the issue to be automatically resolved. You Can Switch to Our Publisher to Reduce Hash Errors When usingSystem Center Updates Publisheror theSCCM 1806+ Third Party Updates feature, you will be more likely to run across hash errors, because there is a delay between when the catalog syncronizes and when you choose to manually publish the content. For example, the SCCM 1806+ catalog feature canonly perform an automatic catalog sync every 7 days, and this is not currently configurable. If SCCM syncronized our third-party update catalog on March 2, 2019, and on that date, Google Chrome 72.0.3626.119 (x64) was the latest version it would be published automatically to SCCM. If we then released Google Chrome 72.0.3626.121 (x64) on March 3, 2019, and you hadn\u2019t previously published the content for Google Chrome 72.0.3626.119 (x64) before it was updated on Googles web server you would receive a hash error. Since SCCM only syncs the catalog every 7 days, you would continue to have hash failures when trying to publish the update content until the next automatic sync occurs on March 9, 2019, or you perform a manual catalog sync in the SCCM console. If you were to switch to ourpublishing service, you would have complete control over how often our catalog syncronizes. The scheduling options will allow you to sync the catalog more frequently to ensure you have the most recent catalog metadata. Our publishing service will always download the most recent catalog before downloading any third-party update content. By downloading the newest metadata, it will ensure we are pulling the most recent updates with the current file digest before performing content publishing. There are other benefits to switching to our publishing service including full automation. You can get more details about the benefits of our publishing service below. ? What\u2019s the Difference our Publishing Service and SCCM 1806+ In-Console Publishing? What if You Receive the Hash Error when Using the Latest Catalog? If you receive the hash digest error afterverifying you have imported the latest catalogandpublishing the latest update, it\u2019s because the vendor just posted a new software update that hasn\u2019t been made available in our catalog yet. You can let us know you are getting a hash error when publishing the latest available update by using ourtechnical support contact form. Generally, we release updates the same day a vendor makes releases the update so it will just automatically resolve itself when we update the catalog.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-rollback-uninstall-third-party-update-in-intune/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to Rollback or Uninstall Third-Party Updates in Intune This article describes how torollback/uninstall a third-party update in Intune. We get asked:how do I rollback a third-party update if there are issues in my environment?This guide will describe your options and some limitations that exist. How to Rollback a Third-Party Update to a Previous Version in Intune To rollback a third-party software update, you can useWin32 app supersedencein Intune torevert an application to a previous version.At the time of writing this article, this supersedence feature for Intune is in public preview. In the example below, we will show how torevert Google Chrome 96.0.4664.45 (x64)toGoogle Chrome 88.0.4324.146 (x64). To perform a rollback, you will need to have an application you want to rollback to as well as the version you want to revert from (the update that was installed). Note:Previous application versions may not be available from Patch My PC if you do not have the retain options enabled in theIntune Optionswindow. Note:If you have any required assignments for the application you want to uninstall, you will want to remove the assignments so that the rolled back version is not re-installed. To revert to an older version, go to thepropertiesof the application you want to revert to and perform the following actions: Click theEditnext to theSupersedence (preview)option > clickAdd> Select thelatest applicationyou want to uninstall > SelectYesunderUninstall previous version> ClickReview + Save> ClickSave. You can now deploy the application you want to revert to with arequired assignment. The required assignment will automatically uninstall the latest update before the rollback to the previous version. It may take some time for the policy to hit your devices and for the full rollback to complete. In our example we added a required assignment in Intune to ourAll Usersgroup. On our client machine, after the policy hits, we can take a look at ourPatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.logand see when it uninstalled the application that will be superseded. If you set the options toShow all toast notificationsfor your assignment, you should also see a notification similar to the one below. In my case, it took about an hour for policy to hit on the client machine. We can view thePatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.logto view when that installed. The installation can also be confirmed in theDownload & Updatessection inCompany Portal. Note:After the superseded role is applied, you will need to either delete the supersedence relationship from the app you reverted to or delete the app completely from Intune. Since we cannot update the dependencies or supersedence relationships for the Win32 apps, we won\u2019t be able to delete the application when an updated version is available. Perform an Uninstall of a Third-Party Application in Intune If you want to remove a third-partyapplication entirely, you can use anUninstall Assignmentto a user group you are targeting. Almost all Win32 apps created by Patch My PC will have theuninstall command. In the example below, we will demonstrate how touninstall Notepad++ 8.1.9.1 (x64)with theIntune Application Managerin our Publisher. To uninstall the application, open the Intune Application Manager in the Publisher > double-click on the application you want to uninstall. Remove any previous assignments for that app and then add anUninstall assignmentto the user group you want to target > SelectOK. This will update the assignment for the Win32 app in Intune and depending on the deadline you set, it will perform the uninstall.

Explanation of TeamViewer Hash Issue In August 2022, TeamViewer began adding unique data to their EXE-based downloads. Due to this change, Patch My PC cannot publish updates to the TeamViewer EXE-based applications, as the unique data added to each download changes the hash of each download file. Patch My PC relies on the hash of the downloaded file to match what is found in Patch My PC\u2019s catalog.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/pmpc-prioritization-criteria/", "title": "", "raw_text": "What Criteria Does Patch My PC Use to Prioritize New Applications and Features? One of our most common questions is thecriteria usedwhenadding new products to our catalog or building new features. In this article, I want toreview the processmyself (Justin Chalfant, Founder) and our engineering team use when evaluatingpending feature and application requestson ourUserVoice. The Basics: We Don\u2019t Know What We Don\u2019t Know The first step in the process is to ensure we know whatnew applicationyou would like to see added to oursupported productsor whatfeaturewould provide you value. Our goal isnot to have the largest update catalog in the industryfor promotional purposes. Instead, our goal is to have alist of supported products that provides our customers with the most value. If you have anew applicationorfeature request, the first step is to submit a new feature request on ourUserVoice (https://ideas.patchmypc.com/). If you don\u2019t submit it here, it\u2019s unlikely your idea will ever be implemented into our product. Before submitting a new request, you cansearchfor theapplicationorfeatureyou would like to see added. If you see anexisting feature matching your request, you shouldup-voteit rather than submitting a new idea. After subscribing to an existing idea, you will receive anemail notificationwhen there are any status updates. How Does Patch My PC Prioritize New Application Requests? There are multiple factors we take into account when working through thesubmitted application requests. One of the biggest factors we start with when working through our queue is how manyunique customershavesubscribedto a specific application request. The number ofunique subscribersdoes not necessarily mean the largest number of votes. For example, an idea with10 voteswith subscribers from8 different companieswould likely be prioritized over an idea with25 votesbut onlysubscribers from 3 different companies. This is why the most important step is to submit your application request if it\u2019s not already in ourUserVoice. Once we determine there is a product that wouldbenefit multiple customers, the next factors thatimpact priority are: Howcomplexis the installer? Does the installer have apublic download? Is the installerdigitally signed? Is the installer downloaded inEXE,MSI, orMSPformat? Does the installer supportsilent installations? Can the installerreboot behaviour be controlled or suppressed? Does the installer supportSYSTEM-level installations? Are there anycustom-actionsorscriptsthat need to be run? We have these requirements because each new product added requires alarge amount of up-front timeand even more time tomaintain all future updates. Our goal is to add around50 new products per month. In ourPublic Roadmap,you can see the recent applications that shipped. Shipped application requests will use the \u201cNew Products\u201d dark blue tag. How Does Patch My PC Prioritize New Feature Requests for the Publisher? The prioritization ofnew feature requestsfor ourPublisheris very different from prioritizingnew application requests. The reason for this is simple. For applications, we know the following: The upfront engineering time will be about8+ hours. Maintaining an application that updates often can be well over40+ engineering hours per year. Many requests for features or improvements to our Publisher can be implementedquicklyand is only aone-time effort, unlike new applications. Since the engineering time can often vary, our criteria for adding features areless based on the number of unique customersand more based on the value we think the request could provide. For example, when filtering byshipped feature request for the publisher,you will see many features shipped with only 1 vote: Oftentimes, these lower voted for ideas that areeasier to implementfrom an engineering perspective may ship in afew weeks. However, there are oftencomplexfeature requests that may take many subscribers before it\u2019s implemented. For example, the feature request to add support forMicrosoft Intunetook about1-year to implementbecause it was difficult and took amassive amount of engineering time. What Does Each Status Mean in the UserVoice Portal? Each idea submitted will have astatusassociated with it. The status will help you know at what point in the process the idea is in. Below is an overview of how we define status: Submitted is thedefault statusassigned to every new idea. This means it\u2019s been submitted, but there hasn\u2019t been any action taken on the request from Patch My PC. We use this state to acknowledge this is apopular requestor a request tosee the value. We want toconsider any request marked noted for a future updatein our product, but there hasn\u2019t been any engineering work yet. We use this status when there is a morecomplicated requestthat we would like to consider adding in the future. We needmore detailsfrom the person who submitted the request in the comments section to understand the request better. Planned means weintend to implement this feature in the future, but we haven\u2019t actively started coding it yet. In the planned status, we also will not generally have an ETA yet. Started means our engineering team isactively codingthe feature. The feature is available in private preview to specific customers and undergoing internal testing. The feature is available in the latest preview build, which can be enabled in theAbouttab of the Publisher. The feature isavailable in the latest production buildof our Publisher or catalog. We willnot be implementingthe feature request. The request can\u2019t be added due tocompatibility issues.

Before this change, we would mark previous versions of software updates as expired. Why are We Making this Change? With theThird-Party Software Update Catalogs feature inConfiguration Manager 1806+, all third-party updates in a catalog are published. When we expired previous updates in our catalog, those previous versions were immediately marked expired when a new update is released. When an update is marked as expired, it can\u2019t be deployed in Configuration Manager. The immediate expiring of updates could cause issues where customers don\u2019t have enough time to fully deploy updates through all testing cycles for products where new updates are released frequently. What\u2019s the Supersedence Model Look Like? By moving to a supersedence model,you will have complete control over how long you want to keep previous versions availablefor deployment that have been superseded. You can control whether you want superseded updates to be immediately expired or delay expiring superseded updates for a certain number of months using theSupersedence Rulesoption on your software update point. In the example below, configuration manager won\u2019t expire superseded updates until they have been superseded for 1 month. In today\u2019s catalog update in our lab, we can see the previous versions of applications are superseded and not expired. This change will allow the superseded application updates to continue being deployed for an additional month in our configuration.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/right-click-options-available-updates/manage-dynamic-assignments", "title": "", "raw_text": "Manage Dynamic Assignments In this article, we will cover theManage Dynamic Assignmentsfeature that allows you to publish application updates to Intune that will dynamically assign to security groups based on pre-defined search criteria. We will discuss how the feature works and recommend some key best practices using it. This feature requires the Enterprise Plus subscription. What are \u201cDynamic Assignments\u201d Prior to this feature, the Patch My PC Publisher was able to create assignments via the right click optionManage assignments. This enabled customers to define Available, Required, and Uninstall assignments which would always be applied to newly published Intune Apps and Intune Updates. These could be referred to as \u201cstatic assignments\u201d. While this provided customers with granular control and consistency, other customers wanted the ability to still automatically create assignments but only apply some groups if theupdate contained a CVE, or wasclassified as a security update, or contained aspecific keyword in its titleetc. This is the premise ofDynamic Assignments. With Dynamic Assignments, the Patch My PC Publisher will evaluate every new update against a pre-configured set of rules (or \u201csearch criteria\u201d) to determine if an update should be assigned to a specific security group. In this way, Dynamic Assignments can also be thought of asAutomatic Deployment Rules(ADRs)\u2026 but for Intune! Evaluation Criteria Below is a list of the available search criteria you can use to dynamically search and create assignments with usingDynamic Assignments: Has CVEThis is a Boolean property.

Update classificationMulti-Select list of the below valuesUpdatesCritical UpdatesSecurity Updates Multi-Select list of the below valuesUpdatesCritical UpdatesSecurity Updates Updates Critical Updates Security Updates Note:To understand how Patch My PC classifies an update, please see this article:Aligning to Microsoft Standards for Update Classifications For example, you could create an evaluation criteria that only assigns updates with a CVE ID associated with them, of \u201cCritical\u201d severity, and classified as \u201cCritical updates\u201d and \u201cSecurity updates\u201d: Search criteria options which allow multiple values (Severity, Title, Update Classification),multiple values will be joined with an \u201cOR\u201d operator. However, all search criteria options will be joined by an\u201cAND\u201doperator. For example, looking at the above screenshot, the criteria forUpdate Classificationwill search for updates with the classificationCritical UpdatesORSecurity Updates. Therefore, theHas CVE,Severity,andUpdate Classificationwill all be joined together with anANDoperator. In English, the above rule will search for updates which contain a CVE ID, and severity of \u201cCritical\u201d, and has Update Classification of \u201cCritical Updates\u201d or \u201cSecurity Updates\u201d. The following illustration of the same rule above may also help with understanding: Note:Dynamics Assignments will apply assignments to newly published updates in the same sync. In other words, it will not apply assignments to updates which already exist in Intune. How to Configure Dynamic Assignments In this section we will detail how to leverage the Dynamic Assignments feature. To configure and manage Dynamic Assignments, in theIntune Updatestab, right click on theAll Productsnode and selectManage dynamic assignments: Opening the feature will bring you to a list of existing evaluation rules. To create a new rule, selectAdd. We will now build a dynamic assignment rule. Below is an example of a rule that will select only application updates that have: CVEs attached Severity classification of \u201cCritical\u201d Update classification of \u201cCritical Updates\u201d OR \u201cSecurity Updates\u201d To validate what application updates will pass evaluation, we can pressPreview(bottom left) to run the evaluation rule against the catalog. In the example below, the evaluation rule has returned only the products that meet the dynamic assignment rule from above. Once you are happy that with your new evaluation search criteria, you can associate Intune assignments with the rule by selecting theManagebutton. This will bring up the standardManage Assignmentswindow used for existing \u201cstatic\u201d assignments. Here you can define either \u201cRequired\u201d or \u201cUninstall\u201d assignments, with the normal options to add Azure Active Directory groups and all the other assignment options, too, including notification options, installation deadline availability and deadline, and restart grace period. These will be the assignments associated with theDynamic Assignmentrule. Once assignments are added, we can verify that the assignments have been applied by checking theAssignmentslist on the previous window. Once we are happy with our new rule, clickingOKwill return us to the list of dynamic assignment rules, which should display our newly created rule. Note:In the screenshot above, we can verify that the rule has assignments attached to it \u2013 this means the rule is \u201cActive\u201d and will perform evaluations when the publishing service runs next. Notes: With this feature, there are some important things to take into consideration: Unlike Configuration Manager, where a product can be deployed to the same collection more than once, with Intune, an application can only assign to a security group once. What this means is that if you have an existingstatic assignmentset to assign an application to \u201cGroup A\u201d and you also set a dynamic assignment rule to assign to \u201cGroup A\u201d based on certain criteria, a conflict will occur. In the case of a conflict,Dynamic Assignments will always supersede static assignments.

Video Walkthrough of Notify the user to close the application feature If you prefer to watch a video guide of how this feature works, please check out the video below. Configuration Options for Notify the user to close the application There are a variety of options available for this feature. Below you can find detailed explanations of each option. Notify Timeout ConfigurationThis option controls how long the user notification will remain open on the screen.Time out after\u2026 \u2013 maximum value depends on the platform. See below for details.While the user notification is displayed, the update or application install is considered to be running.The run time here would contribute to the max run time of your applications and updates, and consume time during a maintenance window, for example.Platform Specific Maximums: Max runtimes account for a 15-minute buffer to allow the application to install after a notification has timed out or closed. (Note: There are newer features in ConfigMgr to default this to a higher value that Patch My PC will investigate)Updates Max: 5 minutesThird-party updates in ConfigMgr can have a few default values for Maximum Runtime depending on your version of ConfigMgr. We default to assuming the maximum runtime of third-party updates will be 15 minutes. Because of this, we have the maximum set to 5 minutes, allowing 10 minutes for the update to run before it would exceed the update maximum run time. See the \u2018use maximum run time\u2019 info below for a workaround to this.ConfigMgr App Max: 705 minutesThis is the maximum configurable run time for a ConfigMgr application minus a 15-minute buffer.Intune (Applications and Updates) Max: 1425 minutesIntune has a non-configurable run time of 1440 minutes (1 day) for Win32 applications.

If the timeout expired and no action is taken\u2026There are two options for when the user does not provide any response to a conflicting process notification within the timeout period. The below event will happen if the notification is left to expire without any user interaction.Defer the installation on behalf of the user (Default):The notification will timeout and be closed and count towards deferral, whether that is a count-based deferral or a time-based deferral.Note:With this option enabled, thesoftware will force close when the deferral count is met, such as having the count set to 5, and the user missing 5 notifications. The application would close and update after the 5 notification timeout.Close the application and perform the update:The notification will timeout, the application will be force-closed, and the update for the application will begin to install.Note: With this option enabled, thesoftware will force closeif someone is not present to dismiss the notification, such as being at the lock screen or otherwise not present.

Manage Process List TheMange process listoption allows you to add and remove apps that need to close in order for the update to process (This applies only if you have Auto-close or Notify option enabled). The UI notification for Conflicting Processes now lists all processes which are conflicting in a dropdown. This is to make it more clear what software will be closed. Add Custom Branding for Notifications In theManage default settingsoptions, you can configure a customer banner image and company name. You can also preview how it will appear for an end-user by clickingPreview how it willappear. Custom Banner Images for Custom Usage We have various banner images available below. You can use these images to customize the experience of the popup or use your company banner. Download ourdefault JPG banner imagebelow. Download thelight-theme GIF imagebelow to show an application close and update completed. Download thedark-theme GIF imagebelow to show an application close and update completed. Customize Notification In theMange default settingsoption, you can customize the notification and add multiple languages under theLocalizationsection. You can add languages by selectingAdd/RemoveunderLocalizationand then fill in the fields for those unique languages and their requirements. The language that is then chosen is based on the language of the machine in question at the time of the UI prompt opening. Note:Keep in mind that youMUSTprovide content for each selected language in each possible intended state. This means cycling through the drop downs underSelected LanguageandIntent. Otherwise you won\u2019t be able to select theOKbutton. Note:You can add additional blank lines when modifying text in these boxes using When to enable: Notify the user to close the application This option can help third-party products whoseinstallers will fail if the application is currently runningin the background by an end-user. The option tonotify the user to close the applicationcan be less impactful than the option toauto close application process before installation. This option is only needed for products that have issues updating while in use. The majority of products can update while in use, but may just require a reboot to fully apply. Below is a list of products we are aware of that will generally fail to update while in use. Update in progress\u2026 When the option is set to \u2018Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating\u2018 we use theImage File Execution Optionsfeature to stop the application from opening. Example usage of this can be seen below. The user would expect to see a message box that says \u2018An update is currently being installed on your computer. Please, do not try to start\u2018 or in some cases\u2018The requested operation requires elevation\u2019depending on the version of PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner.exe. This message box would appear if the user attempts tolaunch the software while it is being updated. In some cases,these registry entries may be left behindif the Scriptrunner process is forcefully closed or otherwise closes unexpectedly. If this happens you may see the above messages even though no application installation or update is occurring.

The error \u201cThe request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.\u201d can happen during any download HTTP request. This error generally will correspond tofirewalls, proxiesorDNS filteringblocking the connection or anSSL/TLS ciphermisconfiguration. Determine if You are Affected If affected, you will see an error similar to below in one of the following log filesPatchMyPC.logorSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.log,dependent on the publishing method you are using. The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel. Note: We are generally pretty limited in the amount of support we can provide for issues related toweb filters,firewalls,proxies,certificate trust, or othernetwork-related errors. However, our resolutions below will generally helpdiagnose and resolvethis specific error. Possible Cause 1: Firewall, DNS, or Proxy Blocking Network Connections The most common cause for this errors us network firewalls or security appliances blocking network connections. If using ourPublisher, thePatchMyPC.logwill show the specific download URL returning the SSL/TLS error. On the machine running with the error, copy the download URL from the log: On the same machine where the Publisher is installed returning the error, browse to the URL inInternet Explorer running as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. Check if Internet Explorer returns any errors or warnings from a firewall or security appliance. Important: The Patch My PC Publisher uses the same .NET Framework classes as Internet Explorer to download content from the Internet. The default identity of the service is also NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. It may be possible you have different Internet access control policies applied between users and computers in your environment. Performing this test in a different browser or as another identity may produce different results. If blocked, you will need to work with your networking team to remove any restrictions. You can find the full list of domains, ports, and protocols used for Patch My PC Publisher and catalogue atList of Domains for Firewall Allowlist when Using Patch My PC. Possible Cause 2: Are You Using A Proxy and is It Configured Correctly? If a proxy is required for internet access within your environment, you will need to configure it in theAdvancedtab: After configuring the proxy, restart the servicePatchMyPCService(can also be done in theAbouttab), and close and re-open the Publisher UI. If proxy authnetication is required, enable theUse Authenticationcheckbox and enter credentials. Possible Cause 3: Is SSL Being Limited to Specific Cryptography Protocols and Cipher Suites? We have also seen issues related to customers that are onlyallowing specific SSL protocols and ciphers. Some customers configure this to apply security harden policies to the Operating System. In this scenario, we have observed the following errors when browsing out to the file download URL in internet explorer. OnServer 2019ornewer: OnServer 2016orolder: Important: The Patch My PC Publisher uses the same .NET Framework classes as Internet Explorer to download content from the Internet. The default identity of the service is also NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. It may be possible you have different Internet access control policies applied between users and computers in your environment. Performing this test in a different browser or as another identity may produce different results. If you receive one of theerrors belowin thePatchMyPC.logand your error is similar to the Internet Explorer images above it may be related to onlyallowing specific SSL ciphers * WebClient report an error during download: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel. OR An error occurred WebClient reported an error during download. The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format. On the server, check if the following registry value exists:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Configuration\\SSL0010002:FunctionsorHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Cryptography\\Configuration\\Local\\SSL\\0010002 If this value exists,only the SSL/TLS ciphersin theFunctions REG_MULTI_SZ valuewill work. If a domain is using a cipher other than ones listed, you will receive the errorThe request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel. Limiting theSSL/TLS ciphersis sometimes enabled as a hardening method for security. Limiting the ciphers is not enabled by default. To fix the download in the scenario, you need to eitheradd ciphersused for all downloads having issues in theFunctions REG_MULTI_SZ listorremove the Functions valueto set the SSL/TLS ciphers to not be limited. There is a third-party tool available fromQualys SSL Labswhere you can paste the download URLs having the issue and the tool will show you theSSL/TLS ciphersbeing used on the domain. For example, when we used the URL https://1.na.dl.wireshark.org/win32/Wireshark-win32-3.2.2.exe, we are able to see the specific SSL/TLS ciphers being used for that domain. These ciphers would need to be added to theFunctionsregistry value to resolve the issue if applicable. *A similar error,\u201cAn error occurred WebClient reported an error during download\u201d, can be observed in thePatchMyPC.logif the HTTP download timed out. It might also be prudent to increase the HTTP timeout value in the registry if the other workarounds in this KB are not effective. Click the following link for more detailshttps://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#topic5 Important: For any new ciphers to take effect after being added, the server will need to be restarted. Possible Cause 4: Windows Server 2012 Doesn\u2019t Support New TLS Cipher Suites Third-party software vendors restrict the SSL/TLS ciphers allowed to connect to their web servers to use more modern algorithms. As a result of this, older ciphers are being phased out. Older Windows Server Operating Systems may experience issues connecting to these web servers as they are limited to specific ciphers. More recently, we have seen the SSL/TLS ciphers available in Windows Server 2012 / 2012 R2 and Windows 8 / 8.1 are being rejected by vendors\u2019 webservers. See below links to Microsoft documentation listing SSL/TLS ciphers for each OS: TLS Cipher Suites in Windows Server 2012 R2 / Windows 8.1 TLS Cipher Suites in Windows Server 2012 / Windows 8 All Windows TLS cipher suites You can view a web server\u2019s current list of accepting TLS/SSL ciphers by using theQualys SSL Labs websitementioned at the end of the last section. To resolve this problem, consider the two options: Plan to upgrade the Operating System of where the Patch My PC Publisher is installed to a newer versions with the newer SSL/TLS ciphers Manually download the installer from a different browser or newer Operating System and save it into yourlocal content repository. Also enable the below highlighted option: We also have this documented on ourList of Known Issues and Considerationsarticle for products we aretracking with these download issues. At this time, we are aware of the following products that may fail to download on older server operating systems: Snagit and Camtasia Tableau Products Cisco Webex Docker Desktop Slack Known Issues For products that are currently known to fail to download, refer to ourKnown Issues and Considerations when Using Patch My PC.

Brief introduction This article will explain the exit codes managed by Patch My PC, using its custom installation wrapper called \u201cPatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe.\u201d \u201cPatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe\u201d is a tool used to install software selected through the PatchMyPC Publisher on client devices, typically managed by ConfigMgr/Intune agents. Besides installing software, it can also carry out various customizations based on your preferences. These customizations may include tasks like removing desktop shortcuts, disabling self-updaters, executing custom scripts, and more. The behavior of ScriptRunner can vary, particularly in cases of installation failure. In such instances, the failure exit code from the software installer will also be returned by ScriptRunner. However, there are predefined exit codes within ScriptRunner that may appear in specific scenarios. These are detailed below. PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner Exit Codes Exit code 0\u2013 means that the execution of your script / the installation of the software completed successfully.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/manage-dynamic-assignments/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Manage Dynamic Assignments In this article, we will cover theManage Dynamic Assignmentsfeature that allows you to publish application updates to Intune that will dynamically assign to security groups based on pre-defined search criteria. We will discuss how the feature works and recommend some key best practices using it. This feature requires the Enterprise Plus subscription. What are \u201cDynamic Assignments\u201d Prior to this feature, the Patch My PC Publisher was able to create assignments via the right click optionManage assignments. This enabled customers to define Available, Required, and Uninstall assignments which would always be applied to newly published Intune Apps and Intune Updates. These could be referred to as \u201cstatic assignments\u201d. While this provided customers with granular control and consistency, other customers wanted the ability to still automatically create assignments but only apply some groups if theupdate contained a CVE, or wasclassified as a security update, or contained aspecific keyword in its titleetc. This is the premise ofDynamic Assignments. With Dynamic Assignments, the Patch My PC Publisher will evaluate every new update against a pre-configured set of rules (or \u201csearch criteria\u201d) to determine if an update should be assigned to a specific security group. In this way, Dynamic Assignments can also be thought of asAutomatic Deployment Rules(ADRs)\u2026 but for Intune! Evaluation Criteria Below is a list of the available search criteria you can use to dynamically search and create assignments with usingDynamic Assignments: Has CVEThis is a Boolean property. Click the value to switch betweentrue / false This is a Boolean property. Click the value to switch betweentrue / false SeverityMulti-select list of the below valuesCriticalImportantModerateLow Multi-select list of the below valuesCriticalImportantModerateLow Critical Important Moderate Low TitlePlain text or Regular expression strings can be used to aggressively filter the evaluation.Exclusions can be achieved by adding a \u201c-\u201d to the beginning of the string.

Update classificationMulti-Select list of the below valuesUpdatesCritical UpdatesSecurity Updates Multi-Select list of the below valuesUpdatesCritical UpdatesSecurity Updates Updates Critical Updates Security Updates Note:To understand how Patch My PC classifies an update, please see this article:Aligning to Microsoft Standards for Update Classifications For example, you could create an evaluation criteria that only assigns updates with a CVE ID associated with them, of \u201cCritical\u201d severity, and classified as \u201cCritical updates\u201d and \u201cSecurity updates\u201d: Search criteria options which allow multiple values (Severity, Title, Update Classification),multiple values will be joined with an \u201cOR\u201d operator. However, all search criteria options will be joined by an\u201cAND\u201doperator. For example, looking at the above screenshot, the criteria forUpdate Classificationwill search for updates with the classificationCritical UpdatesORSecurity Updates. Therefore, theHas CVE,Severity,andUpdate Classificationwill all be joined together with anANDoperator. In English, the above rule will search for updates which contain a CVE ID, and severity of \u201cCritical\u201d, and has Update Classification of \u201cCritical Updates\u201d or \u201cSecurity Updates\u201d. The following illustration of the same rule above may also help with understanding: Note:Dynamics Assignments will apply assignments to newly published updates in the same sync. In other words, it will not apply assignments to updates which already exist in Intune. How to Configure Dynamic Assignments In this section we will detail how to leverage the Dynamic Assignments feature. To configure and manage Dynamic Assignments, in theIntune Updatestab, right click on theAll Productsnode and selectManage dynamic assignments: Opening the feature will bring you to a list of existing evaluation rules. To create a new rule, selectAdd. We will now build a dynamic assignment rule. Below is an example of a rule that will select only application updates that have: CVEs attached Severity classification of \u201cCritical\u201d Update classification of \u201cCritical Updates\u201d OR \u201cSecurity Updates\u201d To validate what application updates will pass evaluation, we can pressPreview(bottom left) to run the evaluation rule against the catalog. In the example below, the evaluation rule has returned only the products that meet the dynamic assignment rule from above. Once you are happy that with your new evaluation search criteria, you can associate Intune assignments with the rule by selecting theManagebutton. This will bring up the standardManage Assignmentswindow used for existing \u201cstatic\u201d assignments. Here you can define either \u201cRequired\u201d or \u201cUninstall\u201d assignments, with the normal options to add Azure Active Directory groups and all the other assignment options, too, including notification options, installation deadline availability and deadline, and restart grace period. These will be the assignments associated with theDynamic Assignmentrule. Once assignments are added, we can verify that the assignments have been applied by checking theAssignmentslist on the previous window. Once we are happy with our new rule, clickingOKwill return us to the list of dynamic assignment rules, which should display our newly created rule. Note:In the screenshot above, we can verify that the rule has assignments attached to it \u2013 this means the rule is \u201cActive\u201d and will perform evaluations when the publishing service runs next. Notes: With this feature, there are some important things to take into consideration: Unlike Configuration Manager, where a product can be deployed to the same collection more than once, with Intune, an application can only assign to a security group once. What this means is that if you have an existingstatic assignmentset to assign an application to \u201cGroup A\u201d and you also set a dynamic assignment rule to assign to \u201cGroup A\u201d based on certain criteria, a conflict will occur. In the case of a conflict,Dynamic Assignments will always supersede static assignments.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/what-wsus-signing-certificate-how/", "title": "", "raw_text": "What is the WSUS Signing Certificate and How to Create It In this article, we\u2019re going to break down what theWSUS Signing Certificateis with regard to third-party software updates, why you need one, and what you need to know when deciding what type ofcode-signing certificateis best for your organization. Why Do I Need a Code-Signing Certificate? In order to create third-party software updates in WSUS or ConfigMgr, they must be signed using acode-signing certificate. Furthermore, your devices must trust the same certificate used to sign updates for the Windows Update service to install them. Without a code-signing certificate, you cannot publish third-party software updates into WSUS or ConfigMgr. By default, updates in WSUS are from Microsoft and client Windows devices inherently trust updates published by Microsoft. By using your own code-signing certificate, you enable your devices to successfully install third-party updates by trusting them. If your devices do not trust the code-signing certificate used to sign the updates in WSUS, they will not successfully install. The Basics of the WSUS Signing Certificate At the most basic level, theWSUS Signing Certificateis simply acode-signing certificate. The purpose of the certificate is to code-sign any content files for third-party updates during the publishing operation from the WSUS API. Before any third-party software update is installed on a device, it will check to ensure the third-party update content wassigned using a certificate the device trusts. If you click the properties of aCAB filefor a published update in theWSUSContentfolder, you will be able to see the WSUS code-signing certificate that was used. If you open the CAB file, you will be able to see thebinaries from the original updatefrom the vendor. For example, we can see theGoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msiwithin the CAB file in the image below. In the event theCAB file was modified, it would no longer be trusted on a device that attempts to install the third-party update. The WSUS Signing Certificate can be viewed in the WSUS certificate store on the local machine usingcertlm.msc. Should You Choose a Self-Signed or PKI Based WSUS Certificate? We get this question a lot from our customers. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this because it depends. Each option has its pros and cons. We have discovered the most common option used by ourcustomersis self-signed. Here\u2019s a list of someProsandConsfor each option: Self-Signed WSUS Signing Certificate: ProsIt\u2019s freeto generate a self-signed code-signing certificateIt\u2019s simpleand doesn\u2019t require aPKIIt can becreated immediatelyConfiguration Manager canautomatically deploy the certificate to clients It\u2019s freeto generate a self-signed code-signing certificate It\u2019s simpleand doesn\u2019t require aPKI It can becreated immediately Configuration Manager canautomatically deploy the certificate to clients ConsSelf-signed certificatescan\u2019t be revokedusing a certificate revocation list if the private key is compromised. You would need to use a script via Configuration Manager or another method to remove the certificate from the Trusted Root certificate store if it was compromised. Self-signed certificatescan\u2019t be revokedusing a certificate revocation list if the private key is compromised. You would need to use a script via Configuration Manager or another method to remove the certificate from the Trusted Root certificate store if it was compromised. PKI Based WSUS Signing Certificate: ProsThe certificate can berevokedif compromisedYou can issue acode-signing certificate for WSUSfrom an internal PKI such asActive Directory Certificate Servicesfor freeConfiguration Manager canautomatically deploy the certificate to clients The certificate can berevokedif compromised You can issue acode-signing certificate for WSUSfrom an internal PKI such asActive Directory Certificate Servicesfor free Configuration Manager canautomatically deploy the certificate to clients ConsA code-signing certificate needs to be issued from aPKIThere will be a cost if you use apublic certificate authorityto issue the code-signing certificate A code-signing certificate needs to be issued from aPKI There will be a cost if you use apublic certificate authorityto issue the code-signing certificate Options for Creating a Self-Signed WSUS Signing Certificate If you decide to use a self-signed certificate, you havethree common waystogenerate the self-signed certificate.

You can create a self-signed certificate or import a PKI based certificate Each tool uses the same WSUS API when generating the self-signed WSUS signing certificate. Creating the WSUS Signing Certificate Using Patch My PC\u2019s Publisher Afterinstalling our publisher, if there is no certificate detected, you can clickGenerate a Self-Signed Certificate. In theCertificate Optionsdialog, you have the ability to adjust thesubject name,validity, andkey length. Once the certificate is generated, you can click theShow Certificatebutton in our Publisher to view more details. You can also view the certificate in the WSUS store usingcertlm.msc. Import a PKI Based Certificate Using Patch My PC\u2019s Publisher If you decide to use aPKIbased code-signing certificate, you have the ability toimportthe exported code-signing certificate (PFX File). We will not cover the process ofobtaining a PKI based code-signing certificate in this guide,as that process can vary depending on the certificate authority you use. We do have a separate article that will covercreating a certificate template and requesting the certificate using Active Directory Certificate Services. Once you have the PFX file for the PKI based code-signing certificate, you can click the button toImport PFX Certificate. Please be aware that if you use a PKI based code-signing certificate, the PFX file can only be imported usingPatch My PC\u2019s PublisherorSystem Center Updates Publisher. You can\u2019t import a PFX certificate directly in the Configuration Manager console, although there is aUserVoice for this feature. Once the PKI certificate is imported, the option for configuration manager toAutomatically manage the WSUS Signing certificatewill still work and can be used to distribute that PKI based certificate to clients\u2019Trusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate stores automatically. Set Configuration Manager to Automatically Manage the WSUS Signing Certificate If you enabled the option toAutomatically manage the WSUS Signing Certificate in the Configuration Manager console, it will automatically generate a self-signed certificate in the eventone doesn\u2019t already exist. To enable this option, navigate toAdministration>Site Configuration>Sites>Right-click the site>Configure Site Components>Software Update Point Note that there are two options here. The difference is explained below. Configuration Manager manages the certificateIf the SUP is remote from the Site Server, please review theadditional requirements when the SUP is remote.If the WSUS code-signing certificate is not found or has expired, then Configuration Managerwill generate a new certificateand store it in the database.If there is an existing WSUS code-signing certificate associated with WSUS, then it will be grabbed and stored in the database.Configuration Manager will automatically distribute this certificate to clients that have the client settings for \u2018Enable third party software updates\u2019 set to \u2018Yes\u2019.

Manually manage the certificateIf the WSUS code-signing certificate is not found or has expired, then Configuration Managerwill take NO action. A certificate must already exist as you have set it to be manually managed.If there is an existing WSUS code-signing certificate associated with WSUS, then it will be grabbed and stored in the database.Configuration Manager will automatically distribute this certificate to clients that have the client settings for \u2018Enable third party software updates\u2019 set to \u2018Yes\u2019.

Configuration Manager will automatically distribute this certificate to clients that have the client settings for \u2018Enable third party software updates\u2019 set to \u2018Yes\u2019. After enabling these options,trigger a software update point synchronizationfrom the Configuration Manager console. You can view thewsyncmgr.logon the site server. This log file will show the WSUS certificatebeing createdorimportedif one already existed. If the WSUS Signing Certificatealready existedbefore setting the \u2018Enable third-party software updates\u2019 option, it will automaticallyimport the existing certificate,and it will allow that certificate to be automatically deployed to client devices. This feature will be helpful if you want to use Patch My PC\u2019s Publisher to create the certificate and benefit from theadditional optionsorimport a PKI based certificate.Configuration Manager can still manage the certificate and automatically deploy it to devices rather than using a GPO. After the sync, the certificate details should appear in theSoftware Update Point Component Properties>Third Party Updatestab You will want to ensure the client settings toEnable third party software updatesis set toYes. This should be enabled on theDefault Client Settingsas well as anycustom client device settingstargeted to devices that will install third-party software updates. When this client setting is enabled, the device willautomaticallyinstall the WSUS Signing Certificate to theTrusted RootandTrusted Publishers.If thethird party updates tab is not configured on your Software Update Pointor theclient settings is set to No, you will need todeploy the WSUS Signing Certificate using group policy. If your software update point isremotefrom yourtop-level site serverand the software update point isnot configured for SSL, the option within Configuration Manager toAutomatically manage the WSUS Signing Certificatewill not work and you will receive an error in wsyncmgr.logRemote WSUS connection is not HTTPS. This prevents the software update point from getting the signing certificate for third-party updates. For more details about this scenario, please see the following Microsoft Doc:Additional requirements when the SUP is remote from the top-level site server. If your software update point is remote from your site server and the software update point is not in SSL, you canuse group policy to deploy the WSUS Signing Certificateinstead of the option in Configuration Manager toAutomatically manage the WSUS Signing Certificate. How to Deploy the WSUS Signing Certificate for Third-Party Software Updates Once you have theWSUS Signing Certificatecreated, it needs to be deployed to all your devices for the third-party software updates to be trusted.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/publish-error-too-many-locally-published-categories/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Publishing operation failed, too many locally published categories. We periodically get reports about the errorPublishing operation failed, too many locally published categorieswhen publishing third-party updates. In this article, we will review the root cause and how to resolve the issue. This error generally happens for customers trying our service who were previously using another vendor. The error message for this scenario will look similar to the error below. An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Publishing operation failed, too many locally published categories. A Little Background on this Error WSUS has a limitation on the number of unique third-party vendors/products that can be published. When troubleshooting with customers coming from another product, we have seen where some vendor catalogs cancause you to exceed the 100 category limit. Here\u2019s an example of all the custom third-party products that may be listed. Due to this100 category limitationand after talking to the Microsoft product group, this is why we decided to use asingle vendor and productin our catalog. Am I Affected? If you receive this error, it means you currently have100 or more categoriespublished to WSUS. The WSUS API checks the total number of categories before it allows an update to be published. Part of the check requires the API to call theGetLatestRevisionNumberForUpdatestored procedure in SQL. This stored procedure is looking in the tbRevision table to see if the category already exists. If it doesn\u2019t, it needs to calculate how many new categories the API call will make and if that total plus the existing category total is larger than 100, the API throws the error \u201cToo many locally published categories\u201d. Note that the stored procedure is checking thetbRevisiontable here. Check using SQL Server Management Studio You can run the following SQL query against SUSDB to understand the total number of categories in the same way the API performs the test. >> Download Category_Count.sql.txt << Note:Rename the extension from .txt to .sql to import the query in SQL Server Management Studio. Category_Count.sql As the API call is only limited by total number of categories, including revisions, for updates marked asisLocallyPublisher = 1, a simple workaround is to change this flag. Changing this flag for all updates in a category will mean the those third party updates will show in the WSUS console. Note:When updates are set to show in WSUS, and the isLocallyPublished flag changes to 0, the CategoryType also changes fromOthertoMicrosoftSource. Check Using PowerShell The following PowerShell snippet uses the built-in .NET Framework\u2019sSystem.Data.SqlClientnamespace to interact with SQL Server Script Example Resolution for Error: Too many locally published categories When you consider which approach you want to take below, Option 1, below, should be considered first, especially for customers who have used an Ivanti catalog in the past and are not comfortable removing updates/categories during a POC. You have 3 options: Option 1:Use the Modify Published Updates Wizard in the Publisher to show updates in the WSUS Console* Option 2:Use theModify Published Updates Wizard in the Publisherto delete updates in a category (Vendor / Product) Option 3:Using aPowershell Scriptto delete updates by Category * Recommended option for customers coming from Ivanti Option 1: Use the Modify Published Updates Wizard in the Publisher to show updates in the WSUS Console In Publisher, theModify Published Updates Wizardallows you to set third-party updates toShow in WSUS. Doing so will flip theisLocallyPublishedflag for an update. Flipping this flag for all updates in the same category will ensure the category, and the category revisions, do not count towards the limit of the API. It can be found under theUpdatestab >Options> selectRun WizardunderModify Published Updates. After running the SQL query shared above inResolution for Error: too many locally published categoriesyou should be able to understand which products to select to reduce the overal category count. In this example, we need to reduce theTotalCategoriescount down from 205 to under 100 In theModify Published Updates Wizard, filter by one of the vendors identified in your SQL query results, clickSelect Alland clickShow in WSUS. Re-run the SQL query again. Repeat this process until the query indicates you are below100categories. IMPORTANT:TheThird Party Category Countdisplayed in the bottom left of the window (shown above) does not account for revised categories or categories that have isLocallyPublished = 0 (This can happen if the third-party updates are set to be visible in the WSUS console). Always use the total category count from the SQL query to understand if you are under the 100 category limit imposed by the WSUS API. Option 2: Using Modify Published Updates Wizard to Remove Categories Our publishing serviceModify Published Updates Wizardallows you to delete published third-party updates. It can be found under theUpdatestab >Options> selectRun WizardunderModify Published Updates. In the example below, we selected two updates from the vendor7-Zipand chooseDelete. Note:To enable theDeletebutton, create a new DWORD registry value: Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Patch My PC Publishing Service: EnableDeleteUpdates = 1 Once you have deleted the updates from WSUS, run theWSUS Cleanup Wizardfrom the Options node in WSUS. You should be able to leave the default checkboxes in theSelect items to Cleanwizard Once you complete the WSUS Server Cleanup Wizard,republish the updates. That\u2019s it!As long of you removed enough of the old vendors and products, you can publish new third-party updates to WSUS Option 3:Running aPowershellScript to Remove Categories Open an elevated PowerShell window. Copy and paste this PowerShell script from our GitHub repository You will want to navigate to our GitHub page and run this script:CustomerTroubleshooting/PowerShell/Remove-WSUSCategories.ps1 at Release \u00b7 PatchMyPCTeam/CustomerTroubleshooting \u00b7 GitHub This will open a UI showing all the categories you have published in WSUS. You can select multiple categories and delete. If you receive an error stating \u201cThe update content cannot be deleted as it is still referenced by other updates(s).\u201d Run the script again with-force. This will ensure it also removes revised categories, which is common with customers migrating from Ivanti. After running with -force, it should say \u201cThe update could not be found.\u201d This indicates we successfully removed the revised categories from WSUS, despite the update referenced under that category not being found.. As long of you removed enough of the old vendors and products, run another publisher sync and you should be able to successfully updates in WSUS. Note:Many customers encountering this error were usingIvanti, if this is your case, you may also be able to use their tool to delete all theirvendorandproductcategories if applicable usinghttps://help.ivanti.com/iv/help/en_US/PAT/24/Topics/Managing_Products.htm Free Trial Schedule Demo Schedule a Setup Call Schedule a Q&A Call ROI Calculator Advanced Insights Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC Publisher Home Updater CVE Insights PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) MEM Patching Optimizer About Us Careers Events & Webinars Customer Reviews Contact Us Call Us: 1 800 250 2334 FAQs Knowledge Base Catalog Release History Product Documentation Release Notes Partners & Resellers Feature Request Product Roadmap Patch Tuesday Blog Patch My PC Blog Support Forum Supported Products"}

This article details common reasons why thelicense validation may failwithin ourPublisher. If you\u2019re facing a license activation error similar to below, this will be the guide for you! Almost all license validationissues are related to proxy and web filters. Step 1: Validate You are Using the Correct License key The first step is to validate you are using thecorrect license key.When you receive yourfull-trialor customer license email, it will contain your 20 character license key. Here\u2019s an example of a license key email. Enter the license key you received in theLicense Informationsection of theGeneraltab and selectValidate. If the license validation is successful, it should look like the image below. Step 2: Are You Using A Proxy? If a proxy is required for internet access within your environment, you will need to configure it from theAdvanced tab\u2019sand apply the new settings. If a proxy is configured,restart the Publisherfor the changes to take effect. You will also need to confirm ifproxy authenticationis required. If so, theUse Authenticationmust be checked and a login configured. Step 3: Web Filters and Firewalls The most common issue with license activation is web filters such asfirewalls,DNS filtering, or othersecurity appliancesblocking the web request. For the license to be validated, please ensure the following traffic is allowed through any web filters, and review any blocked request to the domains listed below. Note:Dependingon firewall restrictions, you may need towhitelist other domainsfor third-party content downloads for vendors in our catalog. For a full list of domains, please seeList of Domains for Whitelisting when Using Patch My PC\u2019s Catalog You can download the Microsoft toolPortQryUIto perform a test to verify access to the domains listed above. Once downloaded, run portqueryui.exe. In the screenshot below we enteredpatchmypc.comfor the domain, and443for the port overTCP. The result should show listening if there are no firewalls blocking traffic. Step 4: Verify the patchmypc.com SSL Certificate is Trusted If trusted root certificate updates are disabled via windows update, the SSL certificate used for patchmypc.com may not be trusted. On the server running the publishing service, open up internet explorer and navigate tohttps://patchmypc.com/. In the address bar, check the certificate lock to see if it\u2019s trusted.

This is commonly referred to as \u2018multitenancy\u2018. This article will document all the features specific to a multi-tenant feature-enabled Patch My PC Publisher. By and large,the core functionality of the Publisher is the sameas detailed in all other documentation. However this article will document exceptions to that rule by highlighting areas that differ in the user interface, or functionality of the Publisher when it is enabled for multitenancy. Multi-tenant management features of the Publisher areavailable for Managed Services Providers using the MSP subscription. To find out more information about this subscription, please seeInformation for Managed Service Providers. Installation Mutli-tenant management features of the Publisher are available in the same installer of the Publisher for all customers. Therefore the installation instructions are the same as currently documented:Intune \u2013 Getting Started (patchmypc.com). A minor exception to the installation process is the Azure App registration. Instead of creating just on Azure App registration in one Azure Active Directory tenant, it is required to create an Azure App registration in each AAD tenant you intend to manage. In other words, if you want to manage 10 customers each with their own AAD tenant, in each tenant create an app registration and enter those in the Publisher as detailed below. Adding the First Tenant After installing the Patch My PC Publisher you can start adding more tenants in either of theIntune AppsorIntune Updatestabs. To configure the first tenant, either clickOptions\u2026or the+icon, and it will produce the typicalIntune Optionswindow. Enter your the tenant\u2019s Azure App registration details including a friendly name to identify the tenant, e.g. customer or tenant domain name. For more information on how to create the Azure App registrations, see our documentation:Azure App Registration \u2013 Getting Started (patchmypc.com). After entering the Azure App registration details for your first tenant, clickOK. This tenant will be currently in-focus for both theIntune AppsandIntune Updatestabs. Enable the checkbox forEnable creation of Win32 applications/updates in Microsoft Intunein both tabs. Products you select inIntune AppsorIntune Updateswill configured for this tenant. Click onOptions\u2026to change theIntune Optionsfor the currently selected tenant. Adding and Removing Additional Tenants To add an additional tenant, click on the+at the top right in either of theIntune AppsorIntune Updatestab. It will produce the typicalIntune Optionswindows where you can configure another tenant for publishing. To remove a tenant, change the currently selected tenant to the one you want to remove from the dropdown. Click on the red cross at the top right in either of theIntune AppsorIntune Updatestab. You will be prompted to confirm you want to delete the tenant. Importing Tenants If you currently manage multiple instances of the Patch My PC Publisher for Intune publishing and you wish to leverage the new multi-tenant functionality, you can import your settings from the other instances into your new multi-tenant installation of the Publisher! Gather the latest Settings.xml from the install directory for each install of the Publisher you support today, and copy them to the host running the multi-tenant featured-enabled Publisher. In either of theIntune AppsorIntune Updatestabs, click the import button and select each (or all) Settings.xml files you want to import. After selecting the Setting.xml file(s) and importing, you will receive a dialogue confirming the successful import. These are the supported configurations carried over when you import settings from another instance of the Publisher: Product selections and theirright click optionsin theIntune AppsandIntune Updatestabs Tenant information (friendly name, authority and AAD application ID) Intune Win32 Application Options As noted in the confirmation dialogue,some previously configured settings may need to be updated. For each tenant you will need to re-configure the following: AAD application secret (If configured) Ensure the code signing certificate is still available for the Intune OptionDigitally sign the detection method script and enforce signature checking on the application in Intune. (If configured) Restore content used forpre or post, installation or uninstallion scripts, and additional files or folders. If you import a tenant that uses these and the content is no longer available in the same path, this will be logged in PatchMyPC.log. It is recommended you either restore the content using the same same path, or restore the content and update the right click option to use a new path. After importing other tenant settings from Settings.xml file(s), all the Publisher settings (inc all tenants) are stored in the single Settings.xml in the install directory of the Publisher. Backup and Restore Publisher Settings The process of backing up the Publisher, and restoring it, is still the same process for multi-tenant feature-enabled Publishers. You can more about that process here:Backup and Restore Publisher Settings \u2013 Patch My PC Manage Conflicting Processes The feature forManage conflicting processesis still availalbe for multi-tenant feature-enabled Publishers, however its UI and configuration options change. This is to allow you set tenant specific settings, such as: Set a unique company logo per tenant Configure the \u2018Organization Name\u2019 per tenant Configure different localization text per tenant You can still configure global settings via theManage default settings, however this enables you to configure the above settings differently per tenant. Alerts At this time, webhook or mail notification settings configured in the Alerts tab is \u2018system-wide\u2019. In other words, the Alerts notifications are used for all tenants.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/java-new-categorization/", "title": "", "raw_text": "New Categorization Methodology for Patch My PC Java Releases In July 2021, Patch My PC added a new flavor of OpenJDK \u2013 Zulu JDK. With this new addition we are trying a new methodology for the JRE/JDK releases. If this new methodology proves to be successful, Patch My PC plans to utilize the same methodology for all other available versions of Java in the catalog. This post will explain the changes we plan to make to the Java installers and why. Currently (for Oracle Java), we create a new product in the catalog for every major Java release (11, 14, 15, etc.), andonlyallow our updates to update existing versions of java that are of the same major release. We believe this is counter to the intentions of these latest releases of Java and are proposing the following (using Zulu OpenJDK as our testbed). In the catalog, we now have the following Products: Zulu JDK LatestIf this product is selected and deployed, the latest Zulu JDK version available will be deployed, this product will upgradeallversions of Zulu OpenJDK on applicable devices to the latest available. If this product is selected and deployed, the latest Zulu JDK version available will be deployed, this product will upgradeallversions of Zulu OpenJDK on applicable devices to the latest available. Zulu JDK 8This product if selected and deployed will only upgrade existing Zulu JDK 8 installations to the latest version of Zulu JDK 8 This product if selected and deployed will only upgrade existing Zulu JDK 8 installations to the latest version of Zulu JDK 8 Zulu JDK 11This product if selected and deployed will only upgrade existing Zulu JDK 11 installations to the latest version of Zulu JDK 11 This product if selected and deployed will only upgrade existing Zulu JDK 11 installations to the latest version of Zulu JDK 11 Switching to this method will allow our customers to choose if they want to patch OpenJDK to the latest available or stay on a supported LTS release. As new LTS releases come out, Patch My PC will add them as new products and provide update definitions until that LTS release hits end-of-life. One major drawback to this new method is that deployments for this new methodology is that if both \u201cZulu JDK Latest\u201dandany of the Zulu JDK LTS releases are selected as a product in Patch My PC, there is the chance of 2 updates being applicable on a single device (say if Zulu JDK Latest and Zulu JDK 8 are both selected and deployed to a device with an old version of Zulu JDK 8, that device will get both updates as applicable and the version that the device will end up with is Zulu JDK Latest). The benefits of this new method are: Customers will not need to update their product selections as often Customers will be able to update to the latest version of Java without an application deployment (Zulu JDK Latest will update any version to the latest, so app deployments to update between major versions are unnecessary) Patch My PC will not need to create a new product for every new release of Java every 6 months (Adding a new product node to the catalog is more time consuming than adding a new update for the same product) Customers will have a clear choice between staying on LTS versions or following the latest Java release. Following a successful test period of Zulu JDK using this methodology, Patch My PC plans to use this same methodology on the next major Java update (planned for September 2021), for all supported Java products in our catalog.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/visual-studio-2022-custom/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to package Visual Studio 2022 as a Custom App In this article, we will show you how you can prepare a package for Visual Studio 2022 and deploy it as a Custom App using Patch My PC Cloud or publish it as a Custom App using Patch My PC Publisher. With its modular installation model, Visual Studio allows you to select specific workloads based on development needs. However, this flexibility also means that packaging Visual Studio for deployment requires careful planning, especially when managing installation size, dependencies, and update strategies. The following guide will focus on thecore editor workloadonly for theCommunity Edition. This article serves as a guide to illustrate how Visual Studio can be packaged as a custom application. However, due to the many variables involved in configuring workloads and application settings, Patch My PC Support is unable to provide assistance with tailoring the package to meet specific customization needs. For detailed guidance on customizing the offline installer, including available command-line options, please refer to theofficial documentation Prepare a package for Visual Studio 2022 The steps below apply to the Community, Professional, and Enterprise editions of Visual Studio. To ensure you always install the latest version of the Current Channel for Visual Studio 2022, download the appropriate bootstrapper from the table below:- In the following example, we will prepare a package for theCommunityedition. Step 1: Download the Stub Installer Download the Visual Studio Community 2022 stub installer from:-https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_community.exe Save it to a location where you have write permissions. Step 2: Create the Local Layout It is necessary to create a local layout which downloads the necessary workload modules and files using the stub installer. Additionally, the layout will set the language for the package. The only workload and component we will use for this example package isMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Component.CoreEditorandMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor.For a full list of componenets and workloads for each edition, follow the links athttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-and-component-ids?view=vs-2022 Additionally, we will use theen-USlanguage locale. For a full list of language locales, seehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022#list-of-language-locales Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window as Administrator. Navigate to the directory where you saved the stub installer. Run the following command to create a minimal local layout:.\\vs_community.exe --layout .localVSlayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.CoreEditor --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor --lang en-US .\\vs_community.exe --layout .localVSlayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.CoreEditor --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor --lang en-US Wait for the download to complete. This may take some time depending on your internet connection. Step 3: Prepare the Layout Package Locate thelocalVSlayoutfolder created in Step 2. Compress the following files and folders into a ZIP archive:Select all folders and files withinlocalVSlayoutexceptvs_setup.exeRight-click and select \u201cCompress to ZIP file\u201d or use a tool like 7-ZipName the archivelocalVSlayout.zip Select all folders and files withinlocalVSlayoutexceptvs_setup.exe Right-click and select \u201cCompress to ZIP file\u201d or use a tool like 7-Zip Name the archivelocalVSlayout.zip Delete the original files and folders from.localVSlayoutafter confirming the ZIP file was created successfully.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/code-signing-impact/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How The Publisher is Affected by Code Signing Certificate Changes Today I want to talk a bit about the Public CA code signing certificate changes that were introduced in June 2023. But first, I want to point out that this only applies to Patch My PC customers that are using code signing certificates issued from Public CAs. Most customers will remain unaffected by these changes I am outlining below. That being said, let\u2019s get into it! If you use the Publisher in conjunction with WSUS/Configuration Manager, you are required to have a trusted code-signed certificate so that Patch My PC can publish third-party updates in your environment. Unfortunately, this process has become more complicated as of June 1st, 2023.Industry standardshave changed to require private keys for standard code signing certificates to be stored on HSMs (hardware security modules). To use a certificate on an HSM, you need to have access to the HSM and the appropriate credentials to use the certificate stored on it. Since Patch My PC and the Publisher cannot access your private HSM, that means that we cannot use that certificate to publish updates in your environment. So, if you cannot use these public CA code signing certificates, what can you do? You have two options: You can transfer to a self-signed certificate (which you can read more about here:What is the WSUS Signing Certificate and How to Create It \u2013 Patch My PC). If your organization has an internal CA, you can request and use a code signing certificate from withinyour own organization. Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to work with the changes we\u2019ve seen to Public CA certificates earlier this year.

Updates are downloaded to a deployment package, distributed, and deployed to clients via ConfigMgr. Clients Install Updates from ConfigMgrClient computers will download the updates from distribution points toC:\\Windows\\CCMcacheand copy the update binaries toC:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download. Next, the ConfigMgr agent will call theWindows Update Agentto perform the actual update installation.TheWindows Update Agentwill then compare the update binary hash for theupdate binary download from your ConfigMgr distribution pointagainst thefile hash stored in the WSUS database. Client computers will download the updates from distribution points toC:\\Windows\\CCMcacheand copy the update binaries toC:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download. Next, the ConfigMgr agent will call theWindows Update Agentto perform the actual update installation. TheWindows Update Agentwill then compare the update binary hash for theupdate binary download from your ConfigMgr distribution pointagainst thefile hash stored in the WSUS database. In short, error0x80246002means the update binary file hash downloaded from the ConfigMgr distribution point doesn\u2019t match the expected value from the update in the WSUS database. Note:The hash error0x80246002is an issue thatisn\u2019t directly caused by Patch My PCor any configurations related to Patch My PC. We will try to cover some common reasons that could cause hash issues and possible workarounds. Possible Cause 1: Corrupt Deployment Package Content One of the more obvious root causes is a corrupteddeployment package.The deployment package is where theupdate binaries are downloadedfromWindows updates(or from the WSUS server for third-party updates). The deployment package is then used as the source for how the updates are distributed to distribution points. If the update content is evercorrupted during this process, clients\u2019 binary downloaded will fail with a hash error. A good first step is trying todelete problematic updatesfrom the ConfigMgrdeployment package(s). You can thendelete the problematic updatesfrom the deployment package. We recommendwaiting up to one hourto ensure the deletion of the updates from thedeployment package source folderand thecontent library. After waiting, you can then try tore-download the update(s)to a deployment package and verify the deployment package is distributed. Possible Cause 2: Updates Deleted from the WSUS Database and Published as Same UpdateID If youdeleted updates directly from WSUS, and the product is still enabled, this can cause hash errors. Note:The delete update buttonis not enabled by defaultbecause it can cause hash issues if an update is deleted, and that product is still enabled, causing the same UpdateID to be republished. If youdelete an updateandthe product is still enabled, it will publish again using thesame UpdateID. This is problematic because thehash of the update will be updated in the WSUS database, but thosehash changes will not sync to the ConfigMgr databasebased on our simulations. This means the ConfigMgr client willdownload the binary from the original updatebefore it was published again. However, the Windows Update Agent will evaluate against the update published second, causing error0x80246002. If facing this scenario, we recommend republishing the affected third-party updates as a new update using the processRepublishing Third-Party Updates to Create New Updates and UpdateID\u2019s Possible Cause 3: Was the Top-Level WSUS/SUP Server Rebuilt? If the WSUS server wascompletely rebuilt, it could cause issues similar to scenario 2, where the new update published with thesame UpdateID to WSUSmay not sync over the new hash and file to the ConfigMgr database. If facing this scenario, we recommend republishing the affected third-party updates as a new update using the processRepublishing Third-Party Updates to Create New Updates and UpdateID\u2019s Republishing Third-Party Updates to Create New Updates and UpdateID\u2019s We have a knowledge base article dedicated to the process of republishing third-party updates using our Publisher hereWhen and How to Republish Patch My PC Third-Party Updates Free Trial Schedule Demo Schedule a Setup Call Schedule a Q&A Call ROI Calculator Advanced Insights Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC Publisher Home Updater CVE Insights PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) MEM Patching Optimizer About Us Careers Events & Webinars Customer Reviews Contact Us Call Us: 1 800 250 2334 FAQs Knowledge Base Catalog Release History Product Documentation Release Notes Partners & Resellers Feature Request Product Roadmap Patch Tuesday Blog Patch My PC Blog Support Forum Supported Products"}
{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/using-patch-my-pc-publisher/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Using Patch My PC Publisher with Azure Update Manager In this article, we discuss the high-level steps for implementation and key considerations when using Azure Update Manager (AUM) to manage third-party updates. While Patch My PC does not integrate directly with AUM, this knowledge base article aims to assist customers already using Azure Arc and AUM in incorporating third-party patching into their existing update management workflows. What is Azure Update Manager (AUM) As customers consider the new technologies and management platforms on offer from Microsoft, many will adopt Microsoft Intune to manage their user devices. This can ultimately lead them to reconsider the need for Configuration Manager for their remaining server estate. This \u201cmindset shift to cloud\u201d also raises questions about how to handle server patching. As customers might already be using Azure in some capacity, AUM automatically becomes very topical in these conversations as \u201csomething we could adopt\u201d. One common misconception is that moving to AUM eliminates the need for WSUS entirely. While this may be true for customers focusing solely on managing Microsoft first-party updates, it is important to understand that AUM provides no direct support for third-party patching outside of WSUS. Customers requiring third-party patching must still maintain their own WSUS instance, whether on-premises or hosted in Azure. Most third-party software vendors provide updates in the form of catalogs, specifically designed to integrate with WSUS. Currently, WSUS is the only Microsoft-supported mechanism for publishing third-party catalogs and distributing those updates to endpoints. Without WSUS, AUM lacks the capability to manage third-party updates entirely, making WSUS an indispensable component for customers with hybrid or multi-cloud environments who require comprehensive patching capabilities. The screenshot below shows first-party updates identified as required during a scan of Microsoft Update, and third-party updates identified as required during a scan of a local WSUS instance. Scenarios While AUM is an excellent tool for managing Microsoft first-party updates, customers requiring third-party patching must still incorporate WSUS into their update strategy. Below are two common scenarios where AUM and WSUS work together. 1. Using AUM with WSUS for All Updates While AUM provides powerful orchestration and compliance capabilities, it does not eliminate the need for WSUS. AUM has no native support for third-party updates outside of WSUS, making WSUS a critical component for any organization requiring comprehensive patch management. Customers should plan accordingly to maintain their WSUS infrastructure and understand its role in supporting both first-party and third-party updates in hybrid or multi-cloud environments. In this scneario, WSUS is deployed either on-premises or in Azure and serves as the source for both Microsoft first-party and third-party updates. AUM leverages Azure Arc to manage update compliance and patch orchestration for on-premises servers, while Patch My PC Publisher remains responsible for publishing third-party updates to the WSUS instance. For customers transitioning from Configuration Manager, it is important to recognize that WSUS updates now require approval, either manually or with automatic approvals, ensuring that both Microsoft and third-party updates are available for deployment. Patch My PC Publisherpublishes third-party updates to WSUS. WSUSSynchronizes first-party updates from Microsoft Update and serves as the distribution point for third-party updates, hosting the necessary metadata and content. Updates areapprovedfor devices (either manually or using automatic approval rules in WSUS). AUMconnects to Azure Arc-enabled servers and orchestrates the installation of updates, while WSUS ensures both Microsoft and third-party updates and content are accessible. Organizations that want a single WSUS instance to handle all update management and maintain full control over patch approval and distribution. This optionmustalso be used for customers wishing to install third-party updates on servers with an operating systemolder than Windows Server 2022. This is because Scan Source is not supported on older operating systems, meaning the devices cannot scan both Microsoft Update and WSUS simultaneously. 2. Using AUM with Windows Update for First-Party Updates and WSUS for Third-Party Updates In this scenario, Patch My PC Publisher manages the publishing of third-party updates to a WSUS instance, while first-party updates are obtained directly from Microsoft Update using the \u201cscan source\u201d configuration. AUM continues to orchestrate the assessment and deployment of updates, leveraging Azure Arc to manage on-premises servers. This approach significantly minimizes reliance on WSUS, as it is configured solely for third-party patching rather than handling the entire breadth of Microsoft first-party updates. By avoiding the need to configure WSUS for first-party updates, you drastically reduce the number of updates managed within the WSUS database. This optimization addresses some of WSUS\u2019s most notorious challenges, including bloated metadata, increased maintenance overhead, and performance degradation that can occur when managing thousands of updates. In this streamlined setup, WSUS is reserved exclusively for third-party updates, allowing it to operate more efficiently while still enabling AUM to handle patch compliance and orchestration for both first-party and third-party updates. Patch My PC Publisher\u00c2 publishes third-party updates to WSUS. WSUS\u00c2 serves as the distribution point for third-party updates, hosting the necessary metadata and content. Updates areapprovedfor devices (either manually or using automatic approval rules in WSUS). Scan Sourceconfiguration allows endpoints to:Retrieve Microsoft first-party updates directly from Microsoft Update.Retrieve third-party updates from WSUS which were published by Patch My PC Publisher. Retrieve Microsoft first-party updates directly from Microsoft Update. Retrieve third-party updates from WSUS which were published by Patch My PC Publisher. AUM\u00c2 connects to Azure Arc-enabled servers to orchestrate update compliance and installation for both first-party and third-party updates. Customers transitioning to a cloud-first model but still requiring robust third-party patching capabilities. This approach is ideal for those looking to reduce on-premises content storage requirements by shifting first-party update handling to Microsoft Update. This option canonlybe used for customers wishing to install third-party updates on servers with an operating system version ofWindows Server 2022 or higher. This is because Scan Source is not supported on older operating systems, meaning the device cannot scan both Microsoft Update and WSUS simultaneously. Note:By downloading first-party updates directly from Microsoft Update, organizations can significantly reduce the storage requirements for WSUS, as first-party update content no longer needs to be stored locally. However, since each server downloads its first-party updates directly from the internet, organizations must plan for potential bandwidth impacts. Unlike Configuration Manager, which can efficiently distribute content via on-premises distribution points, this approach may lead to higher network usage for large deployments. OS Requirements The following Windows operating systems are supported for use with AUM:- Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher (including Server Core)* Windows 10 and 11 clients are not supported by AUM. If customers are seeking a cloud only solution for client patch management, Microsoft Intune is recommended to manage and orchestrate update workloads using the Win32 app model. * IMPORTANT:While AUM supports Server 2012 R2 and higher, customers intending to adopt the scan source approach described inScenario 2must use Server 2022 or higher for the servers they wish to manage. This is because 2022 and later versions of Windows Server support the Windows Update client to scan both WSUS and Windows Update simultaneously. Policy Requirements The following policy settings should be reviewed to ensure devices are able to assess and install third-party updates orchestrated by AUM. 1. Configure the WSUS Server Location (Required) The client will need pointing to the WSUS instance for compliance reporting and to know where to get update copntent from. If you are moving from ConfigMgr for patching, these settings may already be configured in the local policy. Set theWUServerregistry value to yourhttp(s)WSUS instance (REG_SZ) WUServer = https://MyWSUSServer.contoso.com:8531WUStatusServer = https://MyWSUSServer.contoso.com:8531 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate Note:TheWUStatusServeris not strictly required but it will be set if you use GPO or Local Policy Editor to confiure the WUServer location. Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows > Windows UpdateSpecify intranet Microsoft update service location Set the intranet update service for detecting updates = https://MyWSUSServer.contoso.com:8531Set the intranet statistics server = https://MyWSUSServer.contoso.com:8531 2. Configure the UseWUServer Policy (Required) TheUseWUServerpolicy setting specifies whether the device should get its updates from a WSUS server or directly from Microsoft Update. Set theUseWUServerregistry value to1 (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AUUseWUServer = 1\u2014 \u2013 When you configurespecify the intranet Microsoft update service locationusing the ADMX tempalte, this policy is automatically configured and set to 1. 3. Configure an Automatic Approval Rule in WSUS (Required) Configure an automatic approval rule in WSUS to ensure that third-party updates, are downloaded and available for deployment by AUM. This is essential because AUM relies on WSUS to host the necessary update metadata and content for the devices it orchestrates patching for. 4. Accept Trusted Publisher Certifcates (Required) TheAcceptTrustedPublisherCertspolicy allows you to specify whether the Windows update client accepts and processes updates signed by entities other than Microsoft, like Patch My PC, when the update is found on an intranet Microsoft update service location. Set theAcceptTrustedPublisherCertsregistry value to1 (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdateAcceptTrustedPublisherCerts= 1 Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows > Windows UpdateAllow signed updates from an intranet Microsoft update service location= Enabled Note:By downloading first-party updates directly from Microsoft Update, organizations can significantly reduce the storage requirements for WSUS, as first-party update content no longer needs to be stored locally. However, since each server downloads its first-party updates directly from the internet, organizations must plan for potential bandwidth impacts. Unlike Configuration Manager, which can efficiently distribute content via on-premises distribution points, this approach may lead to higher network usage for large deployments. 5. Disable Automatic Updates (Optional) To ensure that the Windows Update agent does not take independent actions, such as downloading or installing updates outside of AUM\u2019s control, configure the system to disable automatic updates. This setting ensures AUM retains full control over the patching process. Set theNoAutoUpdateregistry value to 1(DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AUNoAutoUpdate = 1 Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows > Windows UpdateConfigure Automatic Updates= Disabled Scan Source Requirements (for Scenario 2) If your intent is to use WSUSonlyfor third-party updates as detailed inScenario 2, you will need to configure Scan Source policy to instruct the Windows Update agent to scan both WSUS and the Windows Update service. Note:Utilizing Scan Source to use Windows Update for Business and WSUS together is very well documented at:-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/wufb-wsus The following Scan Source settings are documented well at:-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update Scan Source controls which update source the Windows Update agent will scan and honor for Feature, Driver, Quality and Other Updates (Note: Other does not mean third-party in this context). If your intent is for all Windows first-party updates to come from Windows Update, and all third-party updates to come from WSUS, configure all Scan Source policies to zero. Set the following registry values to0 (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForFeatureUpdates = 0SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForDriverUpdates = 0SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForOtherUpdates = 0SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForQualityUpdates = 0 Additionally, set the UseUpdateClassPolicySource registry key to complete scan source configuration. Set theUseUpdateClassPolicySourceregistry value to1 (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AUUseUpdateClassPolicySource = 1 Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows > Windows UpdateSpecify source service for specific classes of Windows Updates= Windows Update Note:There is no scan source class specifically for third-party updates. \u201cOther Updates\u201d does not mean third-party updates.Scan source Key to Value:Windows Update = 0WSUS = 1 Important:Scan Source only works for Windows Server 2022 + even though AUM is supported on Windows Server 2012R2 + Install on Demand Currently, AUM\u2019s \u201cinstall on demand\u201d functionality, specifically for third-party updates from the Patch My PC catalog, has certain limitations. AUM relies on update IDs that follow a specific format traditionally used by Microsoft\u2019s updates, which differs from thePMPC-year-month-dayformat used in the Patch My PC catalog. This incompatibility can prevent AUM from targeting specific third-party updates for on-demand installation, as the update IDs do not align with the expectations of AUM\u2019s mechanisms. Patch My PC is exploring whether it is feasible to adopt a more compatible KB ID format for updates in our catalog to improve targeting capabilities. However, this effort is still in the exploratory phase, and no confirmed timeline is available for implementation. Customers should take this into account when planning third-party update orchestration with AUM, especially if they require precise on-demand installation functionality. Maintenance Configuration A commonly overlooked configuration when using AUM to orchestrate third-party updates is ensuring that the \u201cUpdates\u201d classification is included in the maintenance configuration. Ensure theUpdatesclassification is included forWindowsoperating systems in your maintenance configuration. Useful Logs The following logs are useful to understand the assessment and orchestration of updates usin AUM.

However, it relies heavily on the underlying Windows Update Agent to execute the actual update scan, download, and installation processes. As such, most troubleshooting steps for AUM overlap with traditional troubleshooting approaches for WSUS and Windows Update configurations. Microsoft has a detailed troubleshooting article for AUM athttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/update-manager/troubleshoot?tabs=azure-machines Azure Arc Problems: Ensure the Azure Arc agent is functioning correctly and reporting health status as expected. Verify that the agent is installed, connected, and synchronized with Azure. Additionally, check the Azure Update Manager for any configuration issues, errors, or failed update tasks that may indicate problems with update orchestration or deployment Policy Conflicts: Ensure there are no conflicting group policies or local policies affecting the update scan or deployment. For example, verify that settings like Specify Intranet Microsoft Update Service Location and Configure Automatic Updates are correctly configured. Setting AUOptions may interfer with AUM orchestration as outlined athttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/update-manager/configure-wu-agent#pre-download-updates Pre-download of updates isn\u2019t supported in Azure Update Manager. Don\u2019t use pre-download functionality through AUOptions while using Azure Update Manager default/advanced patching mechanisms which sets NoAutoUpdate=1 Certificate Issues: For third-party updates, confirm that the code-signing certificate is correctly deployed to the target devices.Ensure the certificate is placed in the Trusted Publishers store, and if it\u2019s self-signed, also in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store. See this article for more information on deploying the code-signing certificate used for third-party updateshttps://patchmypc.com/how-to-deploy-the-wsus-signing-certificate-for-third-party-software-updates Network and Connectivity Problems: Ensure the server can reach the configured Windows Update source (e.g., WSUS or Microsoft Update). Check for firewalls, proxies, or network rules blocking access to required update endpoints.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/security-validation-deep-dive/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Deep Dive Into Security Validation of Updates and Applications We understand IT security is an extremely critical aspect of organizations. IT Security is probably more vital to your organization than the industry on average considering you are actively looking into a third-party patch management solution to help reduce vulnerabilities. We often get asked how we validate the integrity of thethird-party updatesincluded in our catalog. This question is crucial for you to understand. In this post, we will describe in detail the procedures we take to ensure the quality and integrity of the patches we publish in our third-party software update catalog. Step 1: Creating Third-Party Updates and Storing the Hash The first step in our process for creating an update is todownloadthe update binary (EXE, MSI, or MSP) from the official vendor\u2019s download mirror. This update binary will be the file executed on client computers to update the product. The originalhashof the binary anddownload URLis stored in our catalog metadata. Thedownload URLis what will be used when downloading and publishing the update within your environment. Whenever we add new updates to our catalog, thecatalog metadatagets exported andsaved into a CAB file. This catalog (.CAB) is imported into your environment and used to publish updates. To ensure the integrity of the catalog when downloaded and import to your environment, wedual code-sign the catalog filewith our code-signing certificate. When the catalog gets downloaded in your environment, the import will only occur in our publishing service, SCCM 1806+, or SCUP if the catalog is code-signed from atrusted publisher. Step 2: Running the Update Installer Through VirusTotal Once we obtained the vendor\u2019sbinaryand filehash, we then will thenuploadthe binary toVirusTotal. VirusTotal will analyze the binary file through 55+ anti-virus engines. Here\u2019s an example of theSlack 3.3.1.0 MSIbinary file fromStep 1. We post all VirusTotal results for any third-party updates released in ourRSS feedandCatalog Release newsletter. Note:VirusTotal has a 650MB limit for file uploads, therefore, Patch My PC is not able to scan updates larger than 650MB with VirusTotal. Step 3: How Update Binaries are Verified During Publishing Before the catalog metadata is evaluated for publishing, there is adigital signature checkon the downloaded catalog file. This check validates the catalog is signed from Patch My PC. Once the catalog isvalidated, only then will the catalog metadata be evaluated for processing. Since we don\u2019t control theservers used for content downloads, it\u2019s essential to ensure the file downloaded from the vendor\u2019s website is theexact same file used when initially creating the updatethat went through the VirusTotal scans. When an updated binary is downloaded, we will compare thehashof thedownloaded binarywith thehash from the catalogand only publish the update if they match. Step 4: Trust Within Your Environment The final layer of trust for third-party software updates before client-side installation isbetween your servers and clients. Whenever third-party updates are published to your WSUS environment, they are added into a CAB file that getsdigitally signedusing the code-signing certificate that you configure within your environment. Client devices will only install third-party patches that are signed using a trusted certificate that you have configured and deployed to your devices.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-generate-code-signing-certificate/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to generate a code signing certificate and sign PowerShell .ps1 script This guide will show you how to issue a code signing certificate from your internal Certificate Authority, and how to use it to sign your code. Trying to sign code with no certificate available If you would like to sign your own files, and this is done on a machine where no code signing certificate is present, you will get an error. If you are usingSignToolto automatically select the best signing certificate, the verbose output will say:SignTool Error: No certificates were found that met all the given criteria. How to get a code signing certificate One option would be to purchase a code signing certificate online from authorities such asDigiCert. Another one would be to issue one from your internal Certificate Authority, which you can do by following these steps: Create and issue a signing certificate OpenCertification Authority(certsrv.msc) on a machine where you have installed the certification authority. Expand the name of theCertification Authority, then right-click onCertificate Templatesand chooseManage Right-Click onCode Signingunder theTemplate Display Namecolumn and chooseDuplicate template. On the properties of the new template, click on theGeneraltab and give it the name you want. Also, choose the validity period. Save change withApply. Go on theRequest Handlingtab, and make sureAllow private key to be exportedis enabled. On theSubject Nametab, set theSubject name formattoCommon Name. On theExtensionstab, make sure that the description ofKey UsagecontainsDigital Signature. On the Security tab, ensure that \u201cAuthenticated Users\u201d haveReadandEnrollpermissions. Note:You might not want all Authenticated Users to be able to Enroll the certificate, you can add your own custom security group which should have these permissions. You can now click OK and then close the Certificate Templates Console. Back toCertification Authority, right clickCertificate Templates, chooseNewand then selectCertificate Template to Issue. From theEnable Certificate Templates list, select your certificate template and confirm withOK. Requesting a certificate on a machine to use it for code signing On a domain joined machine, openmmc.exe. ClickFileand thenAdd/Remove Snap-in. SelectCertificatesand then click onAdd.

Right-clickCertificates, then go toAll Tasksand selectRequest New Certificate. In theCertificate Enrollmentwindow, clickNextuntil you see a list of certificates to request. The issues certificate should appear in this list. Select it and confirm withEnroll. The certificate should now be enrolled on that device and can be used for code signing. How to sign your code In terms of signing, you can either useSignToolor theSet-AuthenticodeSignaturePowerShell cmdlet. Example 1: SignTool In this example, we used the following arguments: sign = Digitally signs files. Digital signatures protect files from tampering, and enable users to verify the signer based on a signing certificate. /a = Automatically selects the best signing certificate. Sign Tool will find all valid certificates that satisfy all specified conditions and select the one that is valid for the longest time. In our case, it automatically selected the code signing certificate we enrolled. /v = Displays verbose output /fd = specifies the digest algorithm. In our case, we went with SHA256. Example 2: PowerShell cmdletSet-AuthenticodeSignature In this example, on the server where the Patch My PC Publishing service is installed, from an elevated PowerShell ISE instance: On line 1, we get the code signing certificate we enrolled.

The ability to scan Intune for products that are supported by Patch My PC is actively under development and will continue to change. Topics covered in this article: Current Features Limitations Current Features The intent with this feature was to provide some parity to our Configuration Manager scan feature shownhere. The Configuration Manager database contains a monumental amount of data allowing us to provide a good representation of what our product can patch in your environment. The Intune scanning UI can be seen below. Intune Connection: This Intune Connection will share the configuration of the other Intune based features in the product. The configuration for API permissions can be foundhere. There are additional permissions required with this feature beyond what is required for creating applications. Please review thearticleto ensure your permissions are configured correctly. Auto Publishing Rules: If this feature is enabled (checkbox in a checked stated) the Intune scanning will occur every time aPublisher synchronizationoccurs. Based on the results of the scan Win32 Intune Applications, or Intune Updates will be published to Intune if the count threshold is met.The number specified will act as a threshold. When the scan is performed, any software found onat leastthat number of devices will be automatically selected to be published as an Intune application.ie. The threshold set to 30, Zoom Meetings found on 55 devices, Zoom Meetings will be automatically selected for publishingThe dropdown \u201c1 selected\u2026\u201d box lets you configure certain options for the published applications, such as disabling the self-updater if supported The number specified will act as a threshold.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/deploying-the-wsus-code-signing-certificate-within-configuration-manager-using-a-ci/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Deploying the WSUS Code Signing Certificate Within Configuration Manager Using a CI In this article, we will cover how aWSUS signing certificate,or other code-signing certificates can be deployed to your Configuration Manager clients by using aConfiguration Item. A code-signing certificate is a core component in Third-Party Patching. The certificates private key is used to sign the CAB files that will be published to WSUS, and ultimately installed on clients. The client musttrustthis certificate and thecertificate chain. There are use cases where deploying this certificate can be useful via Configuration Item as opposed to something likeGPO, or the built-in Client Settings. One that comes to mind is wanting the monitoring that a Configuration Item provides. Below is a step by step showing how a Configuration Item can be created usingthe script attached here. Additionally, there are steps to help gather the required information. Article Outline: Gathering Info Step 1: Create a New Configuration Item Step 2: Create the Associated Compliance Rule Step 3: Associate the CI with a Configuration Baseline Step 4: Deploy the Configuration Baseline Gathering Info The script itself will need to be edited with your specific Thumbprint and Base64 encoded certificate string. The function contained within the script discusses how to gather these values, but I\u2019ll also note them below. Also, if you are comfortable with Configuration Items within Configuration Manager, you can simply grab the script, adjust for your environment, and deploy away! Certificate Thumbprint:Within the properties of your Code Signing certificate, go to the Details tab and scroll to down to the thumbnail area. This thumbprint will help us uniquely identify the certificate.This can also be copied out of the Patch My PC Publisher, as shown below. Within the properties of your Code Signing certificate, go to the Details tab and scroll to down to the thumbnail area. This thumbprint will help us uniquely identify the certificate. This can also be copied out of the Patch My PC Publisher, as shown below. Base64 Encoded Certificate String:This can be acquired a handful of ways, but a simple way is to get a copy of the certificate as a file and run a PowerShell command similar to the belowSet-Clipboard -Value (::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path .ExportedCert.cer -Encoding Byte))) Set-Clipboard -Value (::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path .ExportedCert.cer -Encoding Byte))) Step 1: Create a New Configuration Item This process will require creating a new Configuration Item, which can be accessed in the context menu as shown below, or within the ribbon when in the node shown. The CI will return a Boolean value, either$trueor$falsebased on the presence of the specified certificate thumbprint. See below, for example, Discovery, and Remediation implementation. Note Data Type is set to Boolean, and the script is modified between Detection and Remediation. A$Remediatevariable is changed based on the purpose of the script. The$CodeSigningCertificateThumbprintand$EncodedCertStringvariables will also need to be populated and should be the same in both scripts. The below screenshots simply show placeholder text. Step 2: Create the Associate Compliance Rule When creating the Configuration Item, you will also configure a Compliance Rule. The compliance rule is the logic that dictates if the remediation script should run, or if the Configuration Item should return compliant or not. Note that we check the box for\u201cRun the specified remediation script when this setting is noncompliant.\u201dThis option is needed to ensure we can perform remediation. Step 3: Associate the CI with a Configuration Baseline With the CI created, we need to create a Configuration Baseline, which can be accessed in the context menu as shown below, or within the ribbon when in the node shown. Alternatively, you could add this CI to an existing baseline you have in place. See the below wizard for an example of the wizard for creating a Configuration Baseline where we are adding our previously created Configuration Item. Step 4: Deploy the Configuration Baseline Finally! The entire point of this article. What you select within this wizard is ultimately up to you. If you want theactionto happen, you, at a minimum, need the check the\u201cRemediate noncompliant rules when supported\u201dcheckbox. Whether you allow this outside maintenance windows, and on what schedule, targeting which devices etc. are all decisions that will be specific to your organization. Assuming all steps were followed, and the values for the base64 string and thumbprint are valid, you should be able to perform aMachine Policy Evaluation Cycleon a client that is targeted with the deployment, and check the Configurations tab as shown below. Once the Configuration Baseline has evaluated as compliant, the certificate should show in theTrusted Root Certificate Authoritiescertificate store and theTrusted Publisherscertificate store and with no \u2018content\u2019 needed! We can store the certificate as a string, very cool!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/migrate-configmgr-to-intune/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Migrate Third-Party Application Management and Patching from ConfigMgr/SCCM to Intune This article provides adetailedstep-by-stepguide on how to make this transition, ensuring a seamless and efficient patch management process. Pre-requisites As a prerequisite, please ensure you have co-management configured in your environment and your devices enrolled into Intune. This article will not cover how to setup co-management, however, you can refer to the following tutorial on Microsoft Learn:Tutorial: Enable co-management for existing clients \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn Move the Client Apps Workload The Client Apps workload is unique because it doesn\u2019t fully transfer app management from ConfigMgr to Intune. Instead, it allows apps to be targeted by both platforms, consecutively. To enable Patch My PC Win32 apps and updates through Intune, the Client Apps workload must be moved. For more details, refer toCo-management workloads \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn Tip:The Company Portal app is now the cross-platform app portal experience for the Microsoft Intune family of products. By configuring co-managed devices to also use the Company Portal app, you can provide a consistent user experience on all devices. Read more atApps in Company Portal \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn To move the Client Apps workload, in the Configuration Manager console: Navigate throughAdministration->Cloud Services->Cloud Attach, right-clickCoMgmtSettingsProdand clickProperties. Go to theWorkloadsandset thesliderforClient appstoPilot IntuneorIntune.With the Client Apps workload moved to Intune or Pilot Intune, the co-managed devices will receive applications deployed from bothConfigMgrand Intune. If you moved the workload to thePilot Intuneposition, you will need to now click on the tabStagingand choose a collection of devices. ClickOKto save and close.Only the devices in this collection will have their Client Apps workload moved to Intune. Reviewing CoManagementHandler.log Connect to a client to make sure that the Client Apps workload has moved as expected. You can check this in two places: \u201cC:\\Windows\\CCM\\Logs\u201d. Open theCoManagementHandler.logand search for the stringCoManagementSettings_Capabilities. Open theConfiguration Manager PropertiesControl Panel appleton the client device. On theGeneraltab look for the fieldCo-Management capabilities. The table below contains workload values that indicate the Client Apps workload has been moved for that device. Configuring Intune Integration in the Patch My PC Publisher If you are already using Patch My PC Publisher today with your ConfigMgr/SCCM and you want to move your current software selection and configurations across to Intune, the process is simple. Firstly, you need to create an app registration in your Entra ID tenant to allow the Patch My PC Publisher to connect to Intune via the Microsoft Graph in order to create Win32 apps in Intune. The following documentation explains how to create the app registration and establish the connection in the Patch My PC Publisher:Azure App Registration | Getting Started (patchmypc.com) Once the app registration is in place, you can begin to configure Intune apps and updates. You can manually select the products and customizations, or copy your existing ConfigMgr apps and customizations from theUpdatestab. Repeat the process for the Intune Updates tab to bring across the same product selection and customizations for Intune Updates. You can find detailed information on setting up the Patch My PC Publisher for Intuneathttps://docs.patchmypc.com/installation-guides/intuneor you can also book a FREE Setup Call with one of our engineers athttps://patchmypc.com/schedule-setup-calland we can help youintegrate the Patch My PC Publisher to Intune yourenvironment. Stop targeting updates from ConfigMgr Co-managed devices are still able to receive applications and third-party updates from ConfigMgr. This may be undesirable if you have moved your Client apps and/or Windows Updates workload to Intune. If you are now using Windows Update for Business Policies from Intune to control first-party (Microsoft) updates and are also updating devices using the Win32 apps created by Patch My PC, you should consider disabling the \u201cSoftware Updates\u201d client setting for those co-managed devices. This will prevent the device from reaching out to WSUS to perform compliance scans and from receiving \u201cSoftware Update Deployments\u201d from ConfigMgr. Targeting third-party updates from both ConfigMgr and Intune is theoretically possible and will not cause any problems. The device will get updatedbutthere is no control over which platform will install the update \u2013 leading to confusion when reviewing deployment reports from either ConfigMgr or within the Intune Admin Center.

In this article we will explore what the Patch My PC ScriptRunner is and how it enables IT administrators to automate and customize the installation of third-party applications and software updates. What is PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner? PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exeisourwrapperthatisused to perform base application and update installations. In addition to installing and uninstalling apps, it is also responsible for any of the customisations configured from Patch My PC Publisher or Patch My PC Cloud. Is PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe safe? PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe is signed, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. It is signed by our EV (Extended Validation)code signing certificate. To avoid interference from security solutions, it is recommended thatPatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exeand its associated binaries be whitelisted in ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules for Defender or the relevant rule for other, alternative, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions:- NotificationLocalization.xml PatchMyPC-Enum.dll PatchMyPC-Localization.dll PatchMyPC-Models.dll PatchMyPC-PreventStart.exe PatchMyPC-Sccm.dll PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe PatchMyPC-UINotification.exe Note:Additionally, some directories such as CCMCache and IMECache, where PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe and its associated binaries are temporarily stored during an installation or update, should also be whitelisted to ensure successful application and update deployment. All Patch My PC recommended anti-virus exclusions are listed atPatch My PC \u2013 Recommended antivirus exclusions What does PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner do? PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe plays a pivotal role in the Patch My PC solution. Its core responsibility is to install and update applications published via the Patch My PC Publisher. This involves executing installation commands, handling updates, and ensuring that the software is correctly deployed on target systems. Contextual OperationsWhether running as a standard user, an admin, or with SYSTEM-level permissions, ScriptRunner knows the difference and applies the appropriate settings. Command ExecutionScriptRunner uses a set of instructions (commands) referenced from various XML files to install or update software, ensuring the installation or update is performed as predetermined by the administrator. Manage Conflicting ProcessIf you use the Patch My PC feature\u2018manage conflicting processes\u2019, then ScriptRunner will also impersonate the user in order to launch a UI to ask the user to close the app in order for the update to be installed successfully. ScriptRunner checks for running processes that might interfere with the installation or update of software. If such processes are detected, ScriptRunner can prompt the user to close them, using components likePatchMyPC-UINotification.exeandNotificationLocalization.xml. ScriptRunner displays notifications to users, asking them to close the conflicting applications to proceed with the installation. Note:As ScriptRunner walks the running process list on a device to understand if an application should be closed in order for the update to be successful, it will inevitabilty touch LSASS.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service). Some admins might have to make an exception to the the ASR rule\u201cBlock credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)\u201d.You can read more about how this ASR rule can interfer with the manage conflicting processes feature atWindows Defender Exploit Guard breaks Google Chrome \u2013 Patch Tuesday Blog Available Customizations By leveraging our own wrapper, ScriptRunner, we can perform customized installations of applications and updates, over and above what the vendor offers natively, by deploying helper files with every application or update we publish. Customizations can include deleting the desktop shortcut, adding additional parameters for the installation, promptingusers to close conflicting apps, running custom scripts, etc. A full list of customizations that we offer within our tooling is documented atRight-Click Options Available for Updates and Applications \u2013 Patch My PC Diving Deeper You may come across a files calledpackage.xmlin the installation source folder for apps and updates that have been packaged by Patch My PC. ScriptRunner will use the content of this XML file to understand how it should customize the installation. In the above example,PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exewill call msiexec.exe and use the following parameters to customise the installation:- /MainFile=InventoryExtensions.msi /MainArg=REBOOT=ReallySuppress\u00ff\u201d/LoggingSwitch=/lv* {path}\u201d\u00ff/LoggingPath=C:\\Windows\\CCM\\LogsPatchMyPCInstallLogs\u00ff/LogRetentionDays=28 Some of the parameters aboveareunderstood by msiexec and othersareunderstood byPatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe. Logging ScriptRunner keeps logs of everything it does helping you track what happened during installations and troubleshoot any issues that arise. You can also enable verbose logs for all the MSI installers that support it and detailed logs will be generated that will definitely help in troubleshooting installation failures, or stuck deployment.

Firstly, let\u2019s select the TeamViewer options file, and add it. Right-click the desired TeamViewer version, and select theAdd custom pre/post scriptsoption. 2. In theAdditional Filessection, browse and select your file, then confirm withOK. You don\u2019t need to add anything else here. 3. Now follow the steps fromScenario 1to add the custom parameter for specifying TeamViewer Options files. Here we will make use of the%CurrentDir%special variable within the Patch My PC Publisher in order to provide a valid path to the .tvopt file during installation. 4. Synchronize the Patch My PC Publisher For ConfigMgr/WSUS software updates, you mustrepublish the update. For ConfigMgr Apps, syncing the Publisher alone is sufficient For Intune Apps/Updates, please delete the package in Intune before syncing 5.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/how-patch-my-pc-handles/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How Patch My PC Handles Products with Multiple Versions Some applications within the Patch My PC Catalog have multiple versions that are all supported at the same time. This article will explain how Patch My PC supports updates for these applications and general rules for working with these applications and updates. Topic 1: Determining Products with Multiple Supported Versions Patch My PC supports a wide variety of applications and updates, some of the applications in the Patch My PC catalog support multiple major versions or tracks at the same time. Patch My PC attempts to support these multiple versions where possible. To determine Patch My PC products with multiple supported versions, look for a version number specified at the end of the product name in the Patch My PC Publisher. If using SCUP or the ConfigMgr built-in 3rd party updates feature, the category usually will specify the version number as well. For Patch My PC Updates (WSUS and Intune Updates) where the version is specified in the Publisher, the following applies: Patch My PC will not upgrade an older version of the software if it is older than the version specified in the Publisher Patch My PC will attempt to provide the latest available release of the version specified in the Publisher Note:To upgrade to a newer major version of a version locked app, deploy the ConfigMgr or Intune Application to the devices to be updated instead of the WSUS or Intune Update. Applications to not have version requirements for installs. Additionally the \u201cLatest\u201d designated update as described in this KB article can also be utilized to upgrade version locked applications (if available). Topic 2: List of Products Where Multiple Versions are Supported Topic 3: \u201cLatest\u201d Version Designation for Patch My PC Products Applications and Updates in Patch My PC with the word \u201cLatest\u201d in the product name willalwaysinstall the latest version of the specified application on devices whereanyolder version of the specified application is found. These Applications and Updates will also usually include a Pre-Script that will remove any older version of the software if found. Tips for \u201cLatest\u201d Version Designation Products: Patch My PC Products with the \u201cLatest\u201d version designation will never be auto-enabled via the database scan features. They must be manually selected in order to be published. Target updates with the \u201cLatest\u201d designation to a specific group of devices where the major version upgrade is to be performed Filter updates with a title containing the word \u201cLatest\u201d from ADRs for Patch my PC Updates, this will ensure that \u201cLatest\u201d version designated products are not accidentally deployed to all systems and can prevent unwanted upgrades.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/delaying-configmgr-base-application-updates/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Delaying ConfigMgr Base Application Updates This article will explain the process of delaying the update of ConfigMgr base applications in the Patch My PC Publisher. Set the number of days to delay the application update In the Publisher, head to theConfigMgr Appstab and clickOptions. For the option highlighted below, you can set the number of days to delay updating base install ConfigMgr Applications published through the Patch My PC Publishing Service. This setting delaysallApplications published through the Publisher. How the delay works Each product in the catalog has a creation date which represents the date the product was added. When the Publisher syncs, each product\u2019s creation date is compared to the current date. Thedifference in days between the creation date and current date is compared to the configured delay. If the configured delay is met or exceeded then the application will be updated during that sync. If the delay is not met or exceeded then a subfolder is created under thePostponedBinariesfolder in the installation directory of the Publisher. Each delayed application will have its own folder containing the postponed binary as well as additional files with relevant metadata and update information. Below are three example scenarios of a delayed application update. Example 1: The Publisher syncs the same day the update is released The publisher is set to sync daily at 7:00 pm. The delay is configured to 3 days. On January 15th an update for Postman is released at 5:00 pm. On January 15th at 7:00 pm the Publisher syncs. A subfolder is created under the PostponedBinaries folder for Postman. Each day during the sync thecreated dateof the Postman subfolder is compared to the current date and the difference in days is checked against the configured delay. On January 16th and 17th, the delay is not met. On January 18th the delay is met and the application is updated in ConfigMgr using the postponed binaries. Example 2: The Publisher syncs the day after the update is released The publisher is set to sync daily at 7:00 pm. The delay is configured to 3 days. On January 15th at 7:00 pm the Publisher syncs. On January 15th an update for Postman is released at 8:00 pm. On January 16th at 7:00 pm the Publisher syncs. A subfolder is created under the PostponedBinaries folder for Postman. Each day during the sync thecreated dateof the Postman subfolder is compared to the current date and the difference in days is checked against the configured delay. On January 16th, 17th, and 18th the delay is not met. On January 19th the delay is met and the application is updated in ConfigMgr using the postponed binaries. Example 3: The Publisher syncs after the delay has been exceeded The publisher is set to sync Monthly on the 15th at 7:00 pm. The delay is configured to 3 days. On January 10th an update for Postman is released at 8:00 pm. On January 15th at 7:00 pm the Publisher syncs. The difference between January 10th and 15th is 5 days, exceeding the configured 3-day delay. The delay is exceeded and the application is updated in ConfigMgr, bypassing the postpone process.

We\u2019re excited to release ourCVE Import Wizardfeature that will allow you to bulk match a list of CVEs from aCSVorTextfile and display details about the status of the CVEs in the document. The Basics of the CVE Import Wizard Our CVE Import Wizard is designed tohelp track the status of a list of CVEs. The most common use case is a security team will provide a .CSV file containing a list of CVEs for tracking. Our tool will then query thefollowing data sourcesto determine if the CVE has any matches: Software updates already published to WSUS/SCCM All available updates in our third-party update catalog metadata The CVE scan will quickly allow you tobulk match a list of CVEsto understand if the fix for the security vulnerability is available from Patch My PC or if you may need to resolve the vulnerability using another mechanism. How the CVE Import Wizard Works To open the CVE Import Wizard, go to theUpdatestab in the Publisher and click theSecurity Documentbutton. Click theBrowse\u2026button to select a CSV file containing a list of CVE IDs and then clickProcess. After the processing is complete, you will see the list of all CVE IDs detected in the table grouped by the state. Available= An update is available within the catalog, but it is not published within your environment yet. Published= The update is already published to WSUS/SCCM and is available for deployment. Unavailable= No update is published that contains that CVE ID and there is no update in our catalog matching it. Here\u2019s an example of a CSV file that contained15 CVE IDswithin it.

Until this reconciliation has completed, we cannot use the Publisher to generate a self-signed certificate. Workaround The Publisher utilises the WSUS API to create a self-signed certificate with an exportable private key. If WSUS is running a stored procedure, the Publisher won\u2019t be able to create a self-signed certifiacte with an exportable key until the current stored procedure has completed. Option 1 If you have recently attempted to run awsusutilreset, orwsusutil movecontentcommand, you may need to wait for that stored procedure to complete before you can run other commands against WSUS. You can check theSoftwareDistribution.logto understand what stored procedures are running against the WSUS database. Option 2 If you do not want to wait for the current stored procedure to complete you can still use the Publisher to generate a self-signed code signing certificate but you would need to disable the private key export. There is not the same reliance on the WSUS API when generating a self-signed certificate without an exportable private key.

We will be reviewing in detail why this scenario can cause issues and how to fix it! Determine if You are Affected by This Scenario Below is a list of possible error codes that may be returned in thePatchMyPC.log. The actual error code you see will depend onhow the proxy/firewall handles HTTP web requests with no proxy defined. Error Codes: An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2147954402 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2147954429 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2147954430 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2147954407 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2148086027 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2149122451 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2149122455 An error occurred while publishing an update to WSUS: Failed to sign package; error was: 2149122449 Additional Details: 2147954402 = The operation timed out2147954429 = A connection with the server could not be established2147954407 = The server name or address could not be resolved2148086027 = ASN1 bad tag value met.2149122451 = Forbidden (403).2149122455 = Proxy authentication required (407).2149122449 = Unauthorized (401). A Little Background on This Error Within our publishing service, we always havetimestampingenabled by default, as shown in the image below. By enabling timestamping, it allows clients to trust updates published even after the code-signing certificate has expired. For example, the example below shows a WSUS Signing Certificate that expires onMay 20, 2023. If timestamping is enabled, clients will trust updates even if they are installed after the expiration date. In thePatchMyPC.log, you can also see the timestamping during the publishing attempt. Why Publishing May Fail when Timestamping One issue that can arise here is related to the way the WSUS publishing API performs the timestamping operation during the publishing. The WSUS API uses theWindows CryptoAPIto perform the timestamp on the updates CAB file. The CryptoAPI uses the proxy defined at theSYSTEM levelon the WSUS server. Because of this, the publishing operation with timestamping can often error out when a proxy is required for internet access. So, even if the proxy is defined within our publishing service or on-site system in Configuration Manager, it will not be used during the publishing operating for timestamping. Workaround 1 \u2013 Set the SYSTEM Level Proxy Using PSEXEC and Internet Explorer To resolve this issue, you will need to configure the proxy at the SYSTEM level on the server. The easiest method to change the proxy at the SYSTEM level is using PSEXEC.exe and Internet Explorer. Download PSEXEC.exe fromhttps://live.sysinternals.com/ Open command prompt as Administrator Launch Internet Explorer as SYSTEM using command line:psexec.exe -s -i \u201cC:\\Program Files\\internet exploreriexplore.exe\u201d In Internet Explorer to Settings > Connections > LAN Settings > Enable \u201cUse a proxy server for your LAN\u201d, configure the IP Address and port, click OK, and close IE Workaround 2 \u2013 Set the SYSTEM Level Proxy Using netsh If you prefer not to use PsExec, or it\u2019s not permitted for use in your organization, you can configure your server\u2019s winhttp proxy usingnetsh. Launch Command Prompt as administrator (cmd.exe) Run the following command line (where the server name and port are set for your environment:) Note:The netsh command doesn\u2019t allow the configuration of explicit authentication to a proxy server. If your proxy server is configured for explicit authentication we recommend making an allowance for the machine account where the publisher is installed. Workaround 3 \u2013 Disable Timestamping Within the Publishing Service Although it\u2019s probably not the best long-term solution, you candisable timestampingwithin the publishing service. Disabling timestamping can also be an excellent method to test if it\u2019s the timestamping operation causing the updates to fail to publish. If you are disabling timestamping for testing purposes, we recommend you only publish a single product such as 7-Zip.

What is the WSUS Content Folder TheWSUSContentfolder is the folder where published third-party updates (.CAB files) are stored. TheWSUSContentfolder maps to theContentvirtual directly in theWSUS Administrationwebsite. TheContentvirtual directory is where the updates are downloaded by clients or downloaded to a Configuration Manager deployment package. If you review theContentvirtual directory in IIS, you can see how it maps to the WSUSContent directory on the file system. When reviewing theContent Informationtab in the properties of a software update in Configuration Manager, you can view the download path for the third-party update from theWSUSContentfolder. If you enabled theWSUS Maintenancefeature in Configuration Manager 1906 or newer, older declined update content should be removed automatically. For a deeper look into theWSUSContent, please review the video guide below. What is the WSUS UpdateServicesPackages Folder TheUpdateServicesPackagesfolder is used primarily for third-party update publishing operations. It\u2019s common for theUpdateServicesPackagesto become bloated with content from obsolete updates. Each folder within theUpdateServicesPackagescorresponds to a third-party update and contains the content downloaded from the vendor and the digitally signed CAB file used for a specific UpdateID. In the folder93171a38-662f-47a7-92c1-4862cbf16146, from the screenshot above, you can find the original binaries downloaded from the vendor for the software update. For a deeper look into theUpdateServicesPackagesand how to clean up obsolete updates from this directory, please review the video guide below. Automatically Cleanup Declined/Deleted Updates from the UpdateServicesPackages Folder Inbuild 2.0.7 of the Publisher, we added a feature to run the UpdateServicesPackages cleanup automatically based onUserVoice idea 797. When enabled, this feature willautomatically delete any declined third-party updates from Patch My PCand thendelete any unreferenced update foldersfrom the UpdateServicesPackages folder. By default, we only delete declined updates for \u201cPatch My PC\u201d updates. If you would like, you can uncheck \u201cOnly delete declined Patch My PC third-party updates.\u201c. When unchecked, we will also delete third-party updates for declined updates of other vendors such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. You also have the option toAutomatically run the Unneeded files clean action in the WSUS Server Cleanup Wizard.This will help clean up the WSUS content folder. Note:If you have downstream WSUS servers that do not share the same SUSDB you may want to disable the automatic deletion and cleanup feature.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/error-code-193-subscribing-sccm/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Error Code 193 When Adding Patch My PC Catalog to SCCM? In this post, we will cover an issue you might encounter when trying to subscribe to our third-party software update catalog in Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. When attempting to subscribe to the custom catalog added for your subscription to Patch My PC, configuration manager will show the following error message \u201cUnable to create the subscription. The console failed to download the catalog from (URL) because oferror code 193.\u201d Why does this happen? This will happens when you are only subscribed to theBasic subscriptionor your subscription hasexpired. This basic subscription is only compatible withMicrosoft System Center Updates Publisher (SCUP)and not the third-party software update catalogsfeature in SCCM 1806 and newer. Why does the Catalog Cost More for SCCM? One of our primary goals is to ensure we provide an affordable solution for third-party patch management in SCCM, so it\u2019s important to address why theEnterprise Subscriptionis required to support SCCMin-console publishing. The reason is related to a new catalog format required for SCCM to support importing and publishing the catalog. The new catalog format is more complex form an engineering perspective. This new format causes overhead for every catalog release. If we take a look into the new catalog format, you will notice there is a new folder called \u201cContentCertificates\u201d Whenever we release a new catalog update, we need to ensure we include every certificate used to sign all update binary files within oursupported productsfor our catalog. The added content certificates allow SCCM to have a layer of trust when publishing all third-party update content. There are currently around 119 certificates we need to manage and maintain when new certificates are used to code-sign update files. Since SCCM doesn\u2019t support any filtering when publishing updates from a catalog, we wanted to ensure we came up with a solution that allows our customers to publish specific products while using our catalog with SCCM. We came up with an optional parameter you can use for onlyimporting specific products into SCCM. The solution for importing the catalog by product requires us to manage a separate catalog for each product on our backend. Whenever new products are updated, we need to maintain the main catalog in addition to a catalog for each product and the content certificates required for each product catalog. We currently support over 150 unique products. Microsoft released av3 catalog formatthat includes filtering options and options for staging content. This new format requires significant work on our end to maintain. Wrapping Up? Hopefully, this has been helpful, and you understand why we decided to require the \u201cCatalog + Automation\u201d subscription to use our catalog with Microsoft SCCM. The \u201cCatalog + Automation\u201d subscription will also allow you to alternatively use ourpublishing servicethat allows more customization such as killing application processes, skipping the update if the application is running, adding custompre/post scripts, and we are working on more awesome features!

This prevents software update point from getting the signing certificate for third-party updates. Since the release of Configuration Manager 1806, some customers report that theWSUS signing certificateisn\u2019t being populated in theThird Party Updates tabof the software update point. It occurs even when the optionConfiguration Manager manages the certificateis enabled. Configuration Manager Manages the Certificate Overview The option to haveConfiguration Manager manages the certificatewill allow ConfigMgr to create a self-signed WSUS signing certificate or todeploy an existing signing certificate. More details about the option toAutomatically manage the WSUS signing certificatecan be found onMicrosoft Docs Why\u2019s Does This Option Not Work? The most common reason why the WSUS signing certificate doesn\u2019t automatically get generated during a software update point synchronization (wsyncmgr.log) is that the software update point site system role is remote from your site server and theremote WSUS server isn\u2019t configured for HTTPS. For example, in the screenshot belowSCCM3-DPMPSUP-1is our Software update point and it\u2019s remote from the primary site serverSCCM3-SITESVR-2 When your software update point is remote from your site server, the optionConfiguration Manager managed the certificatewill only work if the WSUS/SUP is configured for HTTPS/SSL as described in theMicrosoft Docs. If the WSUS server doesn\u2019t have aweb server certificateand hasn\u2019t been properlyenabled for SSL, you will see the following warning in thewsyncmgr.logduring a synchronization. Warning: Remote WSUS connection is not HTTPS. This prevents software update point from getting the signing certificate for third-party updates. Possible Resolutions for SUP not in HTTPS Mode with this Option Enabled You have two options to work around this issue: The first workaround is to create a self-signed or import a PKI-based code-signing certificate for the WSUS Signing Certificate using ourPublishing Serviceand deploy the certificate to clients using an alternative method mentionedhow to deploy the WSUS signing certificate. If you choose this method, you can change the option toManually manage the certificatein SCCM. This option will generally be the most straightforward because you won\u2019t need to request a web server certificate for WSUS and configureWSUS to use SSL. The one disadvantage to this option is clients won\u2019t have the WSUS Signing Certificate automatically deployed to their Trusted Root and Trusted Publishers certificate store natively using the SCCMclient settingto enable third-party updates.

If you perform an error lookup in CMTrace.exe, it will returnThe installation source for this product is not available. Verify that the source exists and that you can access it. 0x8024002D (-2145124307)resolves toA full-file update could not be installed because it required the source. When an MSI-based product is uninstalled, repaired, or upgraded, the previousinstaller (.msi file) must be availableto complete the operation. Access to the original MSI generally isn\u2019t an issue because, during installation, the windows installer shouldcopy the MSI filetoC:\\Windows\\Installer. When a product is uninstalled,Windows Installerwill first try to perform the uninstall using the MSI file cached toC:\\Windows\\Installer. If the MSI filedoes not exist in C:\\Windows\\Installer, it will fall back to the original path used to perform the install. The path to the cached installer is read by Windows Installer from the registry valueLocalPackageof keyHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\UserData\\S-1-5-18\\Products\\Install\\Properties. The path to the original source folder is read from the registry valueInstallSourceof the same registry key. You can see a Google Chrome installer (C:\\Windows\\CCMcache\\3w\\GoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msi) is installed and is in ccmcache. You can also see the file was cached toC:\\Windows\\Installer67aa2f8a.msi. It is worth noting that for repairs operations (the/fswitch ofmsiexec), we noticed that the path(s) listed in the value(s) of registry keyHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Installer\\Products\\SourceList\\Netare used to find the cached or original installer, instead of the previously mentioned registry values under HKLM. If the MSI file doesn\u2019t exist in theC:\\Windows\\Installerororiginal source folder, you will receive this error. For example, we deleted both files above and attempted to uninstall or upgradeGoogle Chrome87.0.4280.88 to anything newer. You can see it\u2019s unable to perform the upgrade in this scenario since the previous version fails to uninstall due to missing installer. Note:It\u2019s common for the MSI InstallSource to not be accessible if it were in theccmcache folderand it was purged. However the primary issue is when the installer is deleted fromC:\\Windows\\Installer. You should avoid deleting any files withinC:\\Windows\\Installer. The common need to do this is to alleviate storage pressures because over time, after installing many applications, its storage capacity can be relatively large on thinly provisioned storage. Instead of deleting the files or the whole folder itself to regain storage space, it is recommended to uninstall unneeded applications. Another common cause for missing installers is with the vendors MSI installer not caching itself toC:\\Windows\\Installer. How to Resolve MSI Error 1612 / System Error 1612 During MSI Upgrade or Uninstall When you receive this error, you will needthe same version of the MSI file,and it also needs to bethe same nameas it appears in thePackageNameregistry value of keyHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Installer\\Products\\SourceList(or what the file name is being prompted for by the Windows Installer dialogue as shown above). Once you have sourced the original file, you have a couple of options: If you have a small number of impacted devices, consider manually restoring and renaming the MSI file to the paths referenced in the registry (InstallSourceandLocalPackageof keyHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\UserData\\S-1-5-18\\Products\\Install\\Properties) Otherwise, using something like Configuration Manager or Intune, you could create an application/package which downloads the file to a predictable path on disk and then update the aforementioned registry values.This method carries a significant risk of causing irreversible damageto the systems in scope. It is highly recommended you fully understand the issue and perform lots of testing before committing to this approach. A safer approach could be including a script within the application/package that tries to determine the needed paths to restore the MSI to and copies + renames it to them. A tool such asFixMissingMSIcan also be an excellent tool in this situation. It will scan the local registry for all installed MSI applications that Windows Installer knows about, and verifies the cached or original installer is still accessible on the system. If it isn\u2019t, it will clearly show you which ones are missing and offer an easy way to restore the file(s) if you have them. Alternatively, you could use consider Microsoft\u2019sProgram Install and Uninstall troubleshooter.

Video Guide for Java Runtime Environment Uninstall Process Please review the step-by-step video guide for information on how to add the JRE removal during the update as a pre-update script. Note:The video shows the process of manually including pre-update scripts to remove JRE. Skip this video and readOPTION 1for the Patch My PC defined scripts. OPTION 1: Using Patch My PC Defined Scripts The Patch My PC defined scripts will allow you to automatically uninstall all versions ofJava Runtime Environment 8 (32-Bit)andJava Runtime Environment 8 (64-Bit). The defined scripts will appear as a right-click option in the Update Rules tab. For example, by default, the install forJRE 8 (32-bit)installations will remove older versions of Oracle Java 8 (x86) prior to installing the latest update. To view this script, right-click theOracle Java 8 (x86)product in ourpublishing servicesUpdate Rules tab and choose Patch My PC defined pre/post update installation scripts. The script will automatically be inserted into the Pre-Update Script box. This option is also available forOracle Java 8 (x64)andOracle Java SE Development Kit 8 (x64)/(x86). OPTION 2: Add REMOVEOUTOFDATEJRES=1 as Custom Command Line This option isNOTrecommended if your environment usesboth the (32-bit) and (64-bit) versions of JRE 8onWindows 64-bit operating systems. The reason we don\u2019t recommend it in this scenario is that theREMOVEOUTOFDATEJRES=1parameter will automaticallyremove both (32-bit) and (64-bit) JRE 8 installs regardless of the version being updated. This causes the other version to become not applicable as a software update, therefore, leaving only one installed version where a machine previously would have had both versions installed. This option shouldonly be used if you are only running a single JRE 8 architecture within your environment. For example only if you use the (32-bit) exclusively or you only use the (64-bit) exclusively. To use this method to remove previous versions during the latest JRE 8 update, right-click theOracle Java 8 (x86) /Oracle Java 8 (x64)and choose toModify command line for product. In the input box for the additional argument addREMOVEOUTOFDATEJRES=1 This command line should have theJRE 8installer automatically remove previous versions using Oracle\u2019snative installer.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/powershell-policy-bug/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Application Creation Bug if PowerShell Execution Policy is Set via GPO As of June 16, 2021, the Patch My PC team was made aware of a bug in the Publisher that affectedapproximately 116 customers. At this time the team has releasedbuild 2.0.6of the Publisher which resolves this issue. The article below describes the scope and remediation steps. Bug Timeline What Caused the Issue: Inbuild 2.0.5(released to self-update channel June 14), a change was made that could cause application creation to fail if the PowerShell execution policy is set via GPO. The error in thePatchMyPC.logwould show: An error occurred while signing the file: Security error. This issue would cause applications that attempted to update in place to fail. For example, ifGoogle Chrome 91.0.4472.101was upgrading toGoogle Chrome 91.0.4472.106,the creation of the newer application would fail. This issue would also cause the content source folder for the previous version ofGoogle Chrome 91.0.4472.101to be deleted. When was the Error Fixed Inbuild 2.0.6(released to self-update channel June 16), we resolved the issue where code-signing of our detection method scripts would fail. What Issue Needs to be Manually Resolved If an application failed to update from build 2.0.4.1, it would cause any future application updates created with build 2.0.6 to lose the association. This means the new version will be created as a new application rather thanupdating the existing application in place. Manual Resolution:We recommend that you copy any assignments (if any) from the old version to the newer version of the application. You would also need to replace the older application with the newer application in any task sequences. Once completed, we recommend deleting the older duplicate version of the application. Remediation Steps and Tools for this Issue The following applications were released after posting build 2.0.5 which may result in duplicate applications if your PowerShell execution policy is set via GPO. We also made aPowerShell scriptavailable to help you identify possible duplicate applications if this scenario applies to you. Info:The script needs to be run on the SMSProvider or you can provide the $ProviderMachineName parameter to the script and specify the SMS Provider name.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/simple-guide-wsus-maintenance-optimization/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The Simple Guide to WSUS Maintenance and Optimization in ConfigMgr In this article, we are going to break down thekey factors involved in ensuring your WSUS server and software update point are healthy and optimizedfor performance. There are many excellent guides out there around WSUS maintenance, includingMicrosoft Docs. Relationship Between WSUS and the ConfigMgr Software Update Point (SUP) Before I dig into why WSUS maintenance is essential, let\u2019s get abasic overview of how Configuration Managerinteracts with WSUS. Even if you have never opened the WSUS console, when a software update point is installed, ConfigMgr configures the top-levelWSUS server to synchronize automatically from theMicrosoft Update Catalog. If you have multiple software update points, any child-SUP will sync from the top-level SUP. When a software update point synchronization runs, ConfigMgr tells WSUS to go sync from theMicrosoft Update Catalog. If you review the ConfigMgr logwsyncmgr.log, you can better see this happening in real-time. Here\u2019s an example of somekey lines in the wsyncmgr.logwhen synchronization is running. Note:In the past, the Microsoft Update Catalog was relatively small, and WSUS would often work great without any type of optimization. It used to be pretty common to hear in the ConfigMgr space that you shouldn\u2019t ever touch WSUS. Why Performing WSUS Maintenance is Now Essential As theMicrosoft Update Catalog grew, the WSUS database did as well. As I recall, the issue of WSUS maintenance started to become a topic around 2017 when customers started tosee timeouts due to an unmaintained WSUS environmentwith a large number of software updates. The timeout error would generally show in thewsyncmgr.log as the following error: Sync failed: The operation has timed out. Source: Microsoft.UpdateServices.Internal.DatabaseAccess.ApiRemotingCompressionProxy.GetWebResponseSync failed. Will retry in 60 minutes At first glance, you may think this is a networking or proxy error since the logline contains the text \u201cApiRemotingCompressionProxy\u201c, but it\u2019s generally not related to the proxy at all. It\u2019s an API call to theWSUS AdministrationIIS website timing out when running aSQL query to get all published updates. This issue generally happens because SQL maintenance such asre-indexing,custom index creation,and otherWSUS maintenance stepshave never been performed. Step 1: Check Current WSUS Performance First, you should get a baseline of how your WSUS database performs before enabling any WSUS maintenance. The stored procedure below will retrieve all updates in WSUS. ThespSearchUpdatesstored produce is called during each software update point synchronization in ConfigMgr. We would hope to see this query executed inunder 30 seconds in a healthy environment. If the query takeslonger than 150 seconds, you may have sync failures and other WSUS performance issues. Perform the following actions inSQL Management Studio>Connect to the SQL or WID Instance>Right-Click the SUSDB>New Query > Type:execspSearchUpdates > Execute or F5 Step 2: Enable the Built-In WSUS Maintenance in ConfigMgr 1906 and Newer The easiest way to ensure WSUS performs well and is optimized is to enable thebuilt-in cleanup and maintenance process. To enable this, navigate to >Administration>Sites>Right-Click the Site>Configure Site Components>Software Update Point In the WSUS Maintenance tab, check the following checkboxes: Decline expired updates in WSUS according to supersedence rules Add non-clustered indexes to the WSUS database Remove obsolete updates from the WSUS database Once enabled, thewsyncmgrcomponent willperform a WSUS cleanup after successfully synchronizingthe software update point. You can see the actions taking place in thewsyncmgr.log Important:Before the next software update point sync is performed, you should ensure theWsusPool in IIS is optimizedusing the steps belowOptimizing WSUS AppPool in IIS for Better Performanceto improve WSUS IIS performance. Step 3: Validate Non-Clustered Indexes Were Created Successfully from Step 2 Based on our research and information inMicrosoft Docs, the single most significant factor to WSUS database performance and the root cause for timeouts is not having the customnon-clustered indexeson the WSUS database (SUSDB). If you successfully performed a software update point sync afterStep 2: Enable the Built-In WSUS Maintenance in ConfigMgr, the non-clustered indexes should be automatically created. However, there are a few scenarios where the automatic creation may fail: The synchronization of the software update point is failing, which causes the step toadd non-clustered indexesnever to attempt. WSUS/SUP uses a remote Windows Internal Database (WID), soConfigMgr can\u2019t automatically create the custom indexes. If the WSUS database is on a remote SQL Server using a non-default port, indexesmight not be added. To verify the non-clustered indexes were created automatically, copy the followingSQL Queryand ensure the result of the query in SQL Management Studio returnsnclLocalizedPropertyID index exists,andnclSupercededUpdateID index exists If the custom indexesweren\u2019t created automatically, you should use the following step tocreate the custom indexes manually:Step 7: Create Non-Clustered Indexes on SUSDB Manually (As Needed) Step 4: Optimizing WSUS AppPool in IIS for Better Performance One WSUS optimization that isnot automatically enabledis changing the WSUS Administration websites AppPool settings in IIS. PerMicrosoft\u2019s WSUS best practice, you should perform the following changes. OpenInternet Information Services (IIS) Manager>Application Pools>Right Click WsusPool>Advanced Settings\u2026 In theAdvanced Settings pane, perform the following changes: Queue Length 2000 (up from default of 1000) Idle Time-out (minutes) 0 (down from the default of 20) Ping Enabled False (from default of True) Private Memory Limit (KB) 0 (unlimited, up from the default of 1,843,200 KB) Regular Time Interval (minutes) 0 (to prevent a recycle, and modified from the default of 1740) ClickOKto save the settings thenright-click the WsusPooland clickRecycle\u2026 Step 5: Check for Un-Needed Products that are Enabled We also highly recommend reviewing theproducts you have enabledto see if there areany products that are no longer needed. For example, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to review this with customers to find unsupported products such as the following enabled: Windows XP Windows 7 Windows Server 2003 etc. To check the products enabled, navigate to >Administration>Sites>Right-Click the Site>Configure Site Components>Software Update Point Uncheckanyunneeded productsand clickOK Step 6: Reindex the WSUS Database (Recommended) While stillconnected to the SUSDB in SQL Server Management Studioopen aNew Query for the SUSDB Copy and paste theT-SQL scriptfrom the Microsoft Docs articleReindex the WSUS databaseand clickExecute. Note:TheReindex the WSUS database T-SQL scriptcan take some time to complete depending on how fragmented the WSUS database indexes are. We also recommend you set up a SQL maintenance plan to re-index the database on a schedule as described in the following video:Top 10 Tips for Optimizing WSUS Performance and Reliability Step 7: Create Non-Clustered Indexes on SUSDB Manually (As Needed) There is a scenario where theBuilt-In WSUS Maintenance in ConfigMgrmay not work if you are already in a very unhealthy WSUS state. If you recall in the step above, the WSUS cleanup and maintenance is performed by thewsyncmgr componentand onlyafter a successful software update point sync. If you are already in an unhealthy WSUS state, you may constantly be receiving timeout errors as shown below in thewsyncmgr.log: Sync failed: The operation has timed out. Source: Microsoft.UpdateServices.Internal.DatabaseAccess.ApiRemotingCompressionProxy.GetWebResponseSync failed. Will retry in 60 minutes When this happens, theWSUS clean up task will never triggerbecause it only occurs after a successful software update point sync. If you happen to be in this unhealthy WSUS state, you will need tomanually perform some of the tasksgenerally automated byBuilt-In WSUS Maintenance in ConfigMgr. After manually performing WSUS optimization and you are able to complete a successful sync the built-in maintenance can take over. We found performing the following two actions will generally be enough to get WSUS in a state to successfully sync. Create custom indexes Create Custom Indexes Manually To createcustom indexes manually, perform the following steps. OpenMicrosoft SQL Server Management Studio>Connect to the SQL Server Running the WSUS Database (SUSDB) > Right-Click SUSDB > New Query Paste in theSQL Query from Microsoft Docsto create the WSUS custom indexes and clickExecute.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/what-are-metadata-only-updates/", "title": "", "raw_text": "What Are Metadata-Only Updates and How to Download and Deploy Metadata-Only Updates? (Blue Icons) In this article, we will cover the topic ofmetadata-only updates. This is a useful feature that is available in WSUS, and subsequently Configuration Manager. What is a Metadata-Only Update (Blue Icon) To clarify what metadata-only updates are, let\u2019s first discuss what the metadata is for updates. The metadata for updates in WSUS contains allthe information about an update, and they appear in the console with a blue icon next to them. Note:Ametadata only update will not show up in a ConfigMgr Automatic Deployment Rule (ADR) Preview for updates. This is because they are not deployable and would not be processed by the ADR. WSUS Update Metadataincludes information such as: Title Description Update Severity Update Classification Superseded Updates Applicability RulesIsInstalledIsSupersededIsInstallable IsInstalled IsSuperseded IsInstallable Command Line Return Code Behavior Note:The above is not a complete list of what is included in update metadata, but provides a summary of important attributes included. Knowing the above information aboutWSUS metadata, a metadata-only update is simplyan update with no content, only metadata. This means themetadata-only updates will not have the content downloaded to the \u2018UpdateServicesPackages\u2019 or \u2018WSUSContent\u2019 directorieswhich WSUS manages. As there is no content the publishing action for an update as metadata-only will be very quick! There is no binary to codesign. But,because this content does not exist the update cannot be \u2018downloaded\u2019 within the Configuration Manager console, as it is a metadata-only update. Below is an example of an update that is published with full content. Note that we do see our applicability based metadata, required, installed, not required. More importantly,this update has a content source path. We can look at the same set of information below for an update that ispublished as metadata-only. You can determine if updates aremetadata-onlyfrom theAll Software Updatesnode if the updates are displayed with ablue icon. Aside from the icon, the \u2018Metadata Only\u2018 column is marked with a \u2018Yes\u2019 and we can also see theContent Information tab shows no source path for the update. This is the key difference for metadata-only updates. Attempting to download an update that is metadata-only will present an error message box stating \u2018All software updates in this selection are expired or meta-data only, and cannot be downloaded.\u2018 Note:Updatesdo not need to be deployedto receive applicability statistics such as required, installed, and not required. The update only needs to be in the WSUS catalog as metadata-only, or full content. Manually Download By Publishing One method of publishing an update as full content is to manually \u2018Publish Third-Party Software Update Content\u2018 as shown below. You can review the full-content publishing progress in theSMS_ISVUPDATES_SYNCAGENT.log. The log is located on the top-level software update point in the site system Logs folder. Once the publishing of third-party update content is complete, you cansync your software update pointfor SCCM to pick up the change from metadata-only to full-content faster. Once the software update point sync is complete, the third-party updates should show in anormal statewith a green icon meaning they are available for software update deployment. Automatically Download Via Stage Content (v3 catalog, ConfigMgr 1910+) Microsoft has made many improvements to the built-in third-party patching features in Configuration Manager. Most notably, starting inConfigMgr 1910you canset a custom schedule for catalogs,set a schedule per catalog, and full support for theversion 3 catalogfor updates. The key improvement with the version 3 catalog is the ability toselect individual categories to synchronize. This is key to ensuring the WSUS catalog is kept to a minimal number of updates. The greater the number of updates in a WSUS infrastructure, the more resources are required on the server, and the more resources are used when a client performs a Windows Update scan. To use these features, \u2018Subscribe to Catalog\u2018 on the desired third-party software update catalog. This will bring up a wizard that is shown below. Within the \u2018Select Categories\u2018 of the wizard, the list of categories provided by the vendor is listed. With the \u2018Select categories for synchronization\u2019 option selected it is possible to specify any number of categories to select. This allows only updates that are of interest to synchronize instead of the entire catalog. Beyond just select certain categories for synchronization, specific categories can also be selected such that ConfigMgr will \u2018Stage the content for the selected categories automatically.\u2019 When the updates are automatically staged for a category, any new updates will bepublished with full contentand automatically downloaded into the WSUSContent directory according to the schedule associated with the catalog. This removes the manual step of selecting updates publishing them. Automatically Publish Updates as Full Content Using the Publisher When using the Patch My PC Publisher, the option is provided to select if an update is published as full content, or metadata-only.By default, all updates will be published as full content, but it is very simple toright-click any update, vendor, or the \u2018all products\u2019 node in the publisher and select to publish as metadata only. The behavior is otherwise identical. Updates will publish into the console as expected according to the configuration specified in the Publisher. Note:If you are publishing updates using the Publisher,only use the Publisher to change from metadata-only to full content. If you have previously published an update as metadata-only, you can open the Publisher back up, right-click the update, and select full content publishing. The next synchronization will ensure the update is published with full content.

If you select multiple updates in the list view, you can check the checkbox by clicking the space key on your keyboard. Note: The filter forEnabled Statuscan be a great option todeclineordeleteold updates for products not currently enabled. If you filter by those that are not enabled, you will find all WSUS updates which are published, but no longer selected in the list of products.\u00c2 Available Actions to Perform on Published Third-Party Updates There are a variety of actions that are available for published third-party updates within WSUS. Patch My PC Modify Updates Wizard Available Options Re-Sign Update The re-sign update will allow you to re-sign an already published update with a newWSUS Code-Signing Certificate. Re-signing can be helpful if your WSUS Code-Signing certificate expired andtimestamping was disabled. Important: If timestamping is enabled (enabled by default), clients would stilltrust updates signed after the certificate\u2019s expiration date. Important: If updates are re-signed, you will need todelete all re-signed third-party updates from your ConfigMgr deployment package, trigger a software update sync, andredownloadthe updates for re-signed updates to be used by clients. Decline This option willdeclinethe third-party update in WSUS. When a third-party update is declined, clients will no longer scan against the third-party update. After an update is declined and a software update point sync is performed, the update will show asexpiredin the Configuration Manager console. Un-Decline This option will revert the declined status in WSUS. Clients will start toscan against this update,and the status will show asnormalin Configuration Manager after the next software update point sync. Delete This option willcompletely delete the updatefrom the WSUS database. We don\u2019t recommend deleting an update if the product for the update is still enabled for publishing. The delete update buttonis not enabled by defaultbecause it can cause hash issues if an update is deleted, and that product is still enabled, causing the same UpdateID to be republished.

This information will help clarify the functionality of some of our base install options, which are highlight below. Option 1: Update existing application\u2019s metadata, deployment type, detection method, and content files (Default) When this option is selected, the Patch My PC Publisher will automatically update the various pieces of metadata associate with the application, as well as the content files themselves. The metadata that will be updated is: Title:Based on customer settings, such as not including the version, or custom application name Based on customer settings, such as not including the version, or custom application name Version:Updated to reflect the new version synchronized from the catalog Updated to reflect the new version synchronized from the catalog Detection Method:PowerShell based detection method updated to ensure the new version is detectedThe script will be re-signed based on customer settings PowerShell based detection method updated to ensure the new version is detected The script will be re-signed based on customer settings Alongside this metadata, the content itself will be updated. This means the binaries for the old version of the application will be removed, and the new binaries will be copied to the application source directory. Once complete, the Publisher will trigger a content update on the Deployment Type for the Application or a package refresh if it is a package. Because we are updating the existing application in this scenario, we have some consideration to keep in mind. Existing Deployments:If the application which was updated has required deployments then the targeted devices will receive the updated policy on their next Machine Policy refresh, including the new detection method, as we\u2019ve created an application revision. The result is that machines may run this installation and update the software based off this application deployment. Be aware of this when creating any required deployments of the Patch My PC managed applications.If the application which was updated has available deployments then the targeted devices will be installing the latest available version of these applications which Patch My PC provides when the user selects install.

The result is that machines may run this installation and update the software based off this application deployment. Be aware of this when creating any required deployments of the Patch My PC managed applications. If the application which was updated has available deployments then the targeted devices will be installing the latest available version of these applications which Patch My PC provides when the user selects install. Task Sequences:If you are referencing these Patch My PC managed applications within a task sequence then you will always be deploying the latest available version of these applications which Patch My PC provides. If you are referencing these Patch My PC managed applications within a task sequence then you will always be deploying the latest available version of these applications which Patch My PC provides. General Consideration:We will be performing an \u2018update content\u2019 on these packages and applications. Any requests for this content while it is being refreshed will, of course, fail, stating that content is not available. Be aware of this, especially with task sequences that reference the content. It could be good to coordinate your publisher\u2019s sync schedule with your high-traffic imaging days and times.

When a new version of an application is released, delay the in-place application upgrade by\u2026 When this option is checkedallapplications managed by the Publisher will have their creation delayed by the specified number of days. The delayed date is based on the date the new application version was synchronized by the Publisher. For example, if Google Chrome was synchronized on February 3rd, and this setting was configured for a 3-day delay, you would expect to see the application be updated in Configuration Manager during a publisher synchronization on February 6th. This feature will result in a logline similar to the below. The updating of the SCCM Application\u2026 is delayed due to settings Option 2: Create a new application without modifying any previous applications This scenario is much more straight forward. Whenever a new application update is available a new application will be created. The publisher will not take any action on the previously created application versions. Even with simplicity comes a couple of considerations. Application Sprawl:If left unchecked this approach could end up leaving tens of application versions per app, or more, in your Configuration Manager environment.Periodically review old application versions and deployments.

Setting this to the value of 0 would ensure, regardless of what radio option you have set from above, that you only have the latest version of applications in your environment. Setting the value between 1 and 10, regardless of what radio option you have set from above, would keep that number of revised applications in your environment. For example, setting it to the value of 1 would mean you would always have n-1 applications for Google Chrome: the latest, and the version prior. This provides you with the benefit of having access to older versions of applications in your environment, as well as the latest, ready to deploy if you need to roll back your devices to a last known good verison. It also keeps your environment tidy by maintaining a set number of applications. Remove administrative categories from retained applications By default, all administrative categories that are associated with a ConfigMgr application are left intact.If this option is selected, then all administrative categories are removed from retained applications. Only the latest published application will have the administrative categories associated with it. One use case for this is ConfigMgr operating system deployment frontends that use administrative categories to populate a list of applications. Delete applications even if they have a deployment This is an optional checkbox which only becomes available when you configure theRetain up to X previously created applicationssetting. It controls whether the Publisher can or can not delete applications in the retaining chain with active deployments. Enabling this option allows the Publisher to delete applications in the chain, even if they have deployments. Leaving this option unchecked does not delete applications in the chain if they have deployments.

In theUpdatestab of our publishing service, you can selectOptionsand run theModify Published Updateswizard to view what updates are published to WSUS. If the third-party updates that aren\u2019t appearing in the SCCM consoledo exist in WSUS, proceed to the next troubleshooting steps. Step 2: Validate Software Update Point Synchronizes from WSUS If the third-party updates were published successfully to WSUS, the next step in the process that could cause and issue is the synchronization between WSUS and SCCM. We recommend performing a manualsynchronizationof your software update point within the SCCM console. Once the sync has started, you should review thewsyncmgr.logusing the CMTrace log viewing tool. You will want to verify in the log file the sync succeeded. In the Configuration Manager console underMonitoring>Software Update Point Synchronization,you can also verify if the last sync was successful. If the software update point synchronization is failing, you will need toresolve the sync issuebefore any third-party software updates will show up in the SCCM console. Step 3: Verify the Patch My PC Vendor is Enabled in the Software Update Point Products In your SCCM console, you will need to ensurePatch My PCvendor andSCUP Updatesproduct is enabled in the Software Update Point Products. Within the SCCM console, navigate toAdministration>Site Configuration>Sites>Configure Site Components>Software Update Point If the product shown above is not enabled, you need to enable the product, click Apply then running another Software Update Point synchronization should resolve the issue for third-party software updates not appearing in SCCM. Important:If you seemultiple Patch My PC Productsand one is not checked, please see the following articleDuplicate Patch My PC Category Listed in Software Update Point Products Tab Step 4: Verify Classifications are Enable in the Software Update Point If updates have been published to WSUS and there are no synchronization issues between WSUS and SCCM, you may not have the requiredupdate classificationsenabled in SCCM. For our third-party updates, we will useCritical, Security Updates, and Updatesclassifications depending on what best matches the release of a specific third-party software update. Within themodify published updates wizard, you can see what classification third-party updates are classified as. If anupdate classification isn\u2019t enabled in the Classificationstab of the software update point, the update will not appear in SCCM unless that classification is enabled and another software update point synchronization is performed. In the screenshot below, we can see the Updates classification isn\u2019t enabled, and that would cause many third-party software updates to not appear in SCCM.

The scan feature allows you to perform a one-time query against your environment as well as automated scanning during scheduled synchronizations and automatic product enabling. How does Scanning Work?

In the event you want to exclude any existing products, you can right-click the product in the update or application rules tab in the publishing service. SQL Permissions Required? For better performance, the query is performed directly against the SQL server and does not go through the SMSProvider. When running the query in the publishing service user interface, it\u2019s performed under the logged on users context.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/third-party-software-updates-maximum/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Third Party Software Updates Maximum Runtime in ConfigMgr This article will detail the requirement to increase the maximum runtime for third party software updates in Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM / MEMCM / MECM / ConfigMgr). Maximum Run Time Explained All software updates in Configuration Manager have a configured maximum allowed time to run, measured in minutes. This is referred to as maximum run time. It is the allotted time for software updates to complete on client computers. If the updatetakes longer than the maximum run-time value, Configuration Manager stops tracking the software updates installationandreturns a failurestatus message. The software update installation will continue in the background, howeverthe client will no longer track its progress nor return its actual result. You may find after the next time the clients performs a scheduled software update scan evaluation cycle, the update may eventually report back as compliant, however this assumes the installation was a success. Maximum Run Timespecifies the maximum number of minutes allotted for a software update installation to complete before the installation is stopped by Configuration Manager. This setting is also used to determine whether there is enough available time remaining to install the update before the end of a maintenance window. The default setting is 60 minutes for service packs. For other software update types, the default is 10 minutes if you did a fresh install of Configuration Manager version 1511 or higher and 5 minutes when you upgraded from a previous version. Values can range from 5 to 9999 minutes. \u2013 Microsoft documentationConfigure software update settings | Set maximum run time. Some products in the Patch My PC catalog takelonger than the default maximum run timeout in ConfigMgr, for example Autodesk Revit. Microsoft expose options to change the default maximum run timeout for different types of software updates in Configuration Manager.However, at the time of writing this, these options do not apply to third party updates(see image below). You can check your updates\u2019 current maximum run time value by adding the column to the All Software Updates view in-console forMaximum Run Time (Mins). You can also check an individual update\u2019s maximum run time by right clicking on the software update >Properties>Maximum Run Timetab. Determine if You Are Affected On the client side, when a software update exceeds the maximum allowed run time, you can expect to see the following: Execution cancelled by job.

Changing the Maximum Run Time Value For accurate reporting of software update installation, it is recommend to change the maximum run time for updates which typically exceed the default run time. Adjust its value by right clicking on the software update >Properties>Maximum Run Timetab: Note:if the software update was already deployed and you change its maximum run time value, in order for the client to recognise the changed maximum run time valueyou must remove the deployment and re-deploy it. Solution Moving Forward Microsoft released a Technical Preview version of Configuration Manager which exposes the option on the Software Update Point to change the default maximum run time for all other software pudates, which includes third party software updates. See the release notes forTechnical Preview 2112when they added this improvement. Customers using Configuration Manager must wait for Microsoft to merge this change into the production Current Branch versions of Configuration Manager. Until Microsoft implement this feature for all customers, you mustupdate the maximum run time value for all software updates that need it.

This error occurs when a client attempts to install a software update which is signed with a code signing certificate that isexpired, and itwas not timestamped. By default,timestampingis enabled in the Patch My PC Publisher to provide you with the flexibility of ensuring software updates can still install on your devices even if your code signing certificate has expired. However if timestamping is disabled, and updates were not timestamped, you will experience this error when clients attempt to install said updatesafter the code signing certificate has expired. Sometimes customersdisable timestamping in the Publisherto workaround proxy or firewall issues totimestamp.digicert.com. We do not recommend disabling timestamping. To determine if have timestamping enabled or disabled in the Publisher, check the registry valueHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Patch My PC Publishing Service:DisableTimestamping. A value of 1 means it is disabled, whereas 0 or a non-existent registry value means it is enabled (the default). You can see the certificate used to sign an update and whether it is timestamped by right clicking on the .cab file and going in toProperties. The .cab file for the problem update can be found inccmcacheon the client, or theWsusContentdirectory on the WSUS/SUP server. Go to theDigital Signaturestab, select the certificate from the list and chooseDetails. From here you can see if the .cab file is timestamped in theCountersignaturessection at the botom. ClickView Certificateand verify if the certificate has expired. Step 1: Renew your code signing certificate and import it into the Publisher If you use an internally issued certificate from your own PKI root / intermediate Certificate Authorities,re-issue a new code signing certificate. Ensure your devices have this new certificate in theirTrusted Publisherscertificate store. If you use a self-signed certificate, regenerate a new code signing certificate and ensure your devices have this new certificate in theirTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate store. After you have obtaineda new valid certificate, import it into the Publisher. Note:If your SUP is remote from your site server, ensure this new certificate is also in theTrusted RootandTrusted Publisherscertificate storeon the site serveritself. Step 2: Re-publish the software update(s) Next, you mustre-publish the problem updates,so they are recreated in WSUS witha new .cab file using a new code signing certificate. We have an article that discussesWhen and How to Republish Patch My PC Third-Party Updatesin more detail if you want to learn more. Right-click on the offending updates and chooseRepublish update(s) for these product(s) during the next sync schedule. For the subsequent pop-ups, selectYesfor the first pop-up, and we recommend you consider selectingYesfor the second pop-up.\u00c3\u0082 Step 3: Sync, the Publisher, download the updates, distribute, and deploy After that, you need tosync the Publisherto republish the software update to WSUS again. In theSync Scheduletab, clickRun Publishing Service Sync. Once the Publisher has finished synchronizing and your SCCM SUP has synchronized with WSUS, you can now download, distribute and deploy the newly republished software update(s),which will be code signed using the new certificate. You can verify the republished update is using the new certificate by observing the certificate on the .cab file stored in the WsusContent directory on your WSUS/SUP server as shown previously at the end of theDetermine if You are Affected section.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/view-applicability-troubleshoot/", "title": "", "raw_text": "View Applicability Rules and Troubleshoot Detection States for Third-Party Updates Viewing theapplicability rulesof athird-party updatecan help determine why an update does not appear in software center or install within SCCM. This article looks at how theupdate applicabilityis determined forthird-party updateswithin our catalog. This guide will be helpful to determine why third-party software updates may not install on devices or report as required in Configuration Manager. Step 1: Understand the Different Software Update States Here\u2019s a review of thestatesavailable for software updates within Configuration Manager and WSUS. Compliant= The software update has been detected as being installed.Required= The software update has been detected as being needed, but it hasn\u2019t been reported as installed.Not Required= The software update has been detected as not being applicable. This status is what we will be looking deeper into here.Unknown= The software update hasn\u2019t been evaluated yet on the client. Step 2: Determine the Detection State of a Software Update on All Systems When you are troubleshooting why a third-party software update isn\u2019t appearing in software center or installing on a specific device or a large number of devices, the best first step is to click the update within theAll Software Updates nodeand review what is theoverall detectionfor all systems. The overall detection results can be helpful in understanding if the detection seems incorrect for all systems or if only a few devices seem not to be detecting the update state correctly. For example, if a large number of devices have anUnknowndetection state, it\u2019s likely an issue where the WSUS Administration IIS application pool is stopped, or the clients have a WSUS GPO conflict causing machines not to scan against the software update successfully. Step 3: Determine the Detection State of a Software Update on a Specific Computer If you are troubleshooting a specific computer not receiving a third-party update, run the following built-in report within Configuration Managers console underMonitoring>Reporting>Reports>Software Updates \u2013 A Compliance>Compliance 5 \u2013 Specific computer. This report will allow you to review if the software update is detecting asInstalledorRequiredon the specific computer in question. Step 4: Determine the Detection State of a Software Update on a Device Collection Next, you can expand the search to review the detect states on aspecific collection of devices. For example, you could choose a collection where the software update has been deployed. From the Configuration Managers consol navigate toMonitoring>Reporting>Reports>Software Updates \u2013 A Compliance>Compliance 2 \u2013 Specific software update. Review the differentdetection statesfor thespecific software updatein question. Step 5: Check the Software Update Group\u2019s Deployment Completion Statistics If the detect state looks correct and the update(s) in question appear as required, the next step is to review the deployment completion statistics from the Deployments node of the console. From the Configuration Managers console navigate toMonitoring>Deployments>Select the Software Update Group\u2019s Deployment, and review theCompletion Statisticschart. Review the differentstatesthat devices are in for the deployment. If you have a large number of devices in anIn ProgressorFailedstate, this could explain why machines aren\u2019t installing the software update. Click theView Statuslink below the chart to review a more detailed view of devices in specific states. For example, if a large number of devices are in anIn Progressstate, it could be because the software update deployment package isn\u2019t fully distributed or boundaries and boundary groups aren\u2019t configured correctly for all clients. Determining Software Update Applicability Rules when the State is Reporting Inaccurately If the software update is detecting asNot Applicableon a device where it should (Anolder version of the product is installed), you can review the detection rules of the software update using one of the processes below. Modify Updates Wizard One way to get the applicability rules for the software updateNotepad++ 8.1.3 (x64)is to launch theModify Published Updateswizard in theOptionsmenu of theUpdatestab. Select the update that isn\u2019t being detected as Required and clickShow Applicability Rules. Show Package Info Another way to view applicability rules for an update is by using the \u2018Show package info\u2026\u2018 right-click option. Once you have selectedshow package info from the right-click menuyou candouble-clickon any given product listed and view the applicability rules. Note:When you double click a product from the \u2018Show Package Info\u2019 tool you are querying thelatest catalogfor applicability rules. When you select an update in the Modify Updates wizard you are viewing theapplicability rules for the selected update. In this wizard, you can review the rules determined to show if an update will be detected as required on a client machine in theIsInstallable Rulessection. For the updateNotepad++ 8.1.3 (x64)to show as required, the following registry conditions need to exist: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Subkey=\u201dSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsCurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Notepad++:DisplayVersion\u201d exis HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Subkey=\u201dSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsCurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Notepad++:DisplayVersion\u201d < \u201c8.1.3.0\u201d On a client machine, you can then review if the rules would evaluate.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/kb/using-dns-aliases-wsus-third/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Using DNS aliases with WSUS and third-party patching In this KB we will discuss another scenario which can cause the error \u201cCreateDirectory failed\u201d seen inPatchMyPC.log and SoftwareDistribution.logwhen trying to publish new third-party software updates into WSUS and/or Configuration Manager. While there are a few other solutions to this problem, as detailed in theCreateDirectory failed Error when Publishing Third-Party Updatesarticle, this is an alternative solution proposed to address the error. However, your applicability for the solutions proposed in this article depends on whether your WSUS service is configured to use HTTPS and if you are using a DNS alias for your WSUS server address. It may be desirable for organisations to use a DNS alias for WSUS, especially if WSUS is exposed across the Internet; it can simplify certificate requirements and help obfuscate internal hostnames. It is strongly advised to first read theDetermine if you are affectedsection below to determine if either of the proposed solutions are applicable to you. Topicscovered in this article: Determine if You are Affected Solution 1: Reconfigure your WSUS HTTPS config to match the AD FQDN address Solution 2: Configure a CIFS Service Principle for your WSUS server with your CNAME alias Determine if You are Affected Before you execute either solution proposed in this article, it is recommended you understand if you are affected and meet the criteria. You can do this by verifying the three conditions below: Firstly, to be affected by this issue, in the below registry key, the valueUsingSSLwill equal to 1 butServerCertificateNamewill be a different address compared to the server\u2019s Active Directory (AD) FQDN address (that\u2019s assuming the WSUS server is domain-joined, otherwise it would be different to the server\u2019s hostname.) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Update Services\\Server\\Setup If the above is true for you, this means you likely have a DNS record configured, on a DNS server you manage, likely of type CNAME (although this can be an A record if WSUS is Internet-accessible and using a public DNS), pointing to your WSUS server\u2019s IP address. Secondly, you will also see the below errors inPatchMyPC.log and SoftwareDistribution.logwhile attempting to publish new third-party software updates: PatchMyPC.log: The publishing failed with error: CreateDirectory failed (timestamping was enabled). We will attempt to publish the update again with timestamping disabled. CreateDirectory failed. ErrorCode:-2147467259 NativeErrorCode:1326 HResult:-2147467259 MethodName:CreateDirectory. This error appears to be a known error. Please see our KB article https://patchmypc.com/an-error-occurred-while-publishing-an-update-to-wsus-createdirectory-failed for the resolution. SoftwareDistribution.log: ErrorPatchMyPC-Service.8Publisher.PublishPackagePublishPackage(): Operation Failed with Error: CreateDirectory failed Lastly, if you perform aProcess Monitor capturewhile the Patch My PC Publisher is synchronising and produces the error, you will see aLOGON FAILUREwhenPatchMyPC-Service.exetries toCreateFilein theUpdateServicesPackagesshared folder. You will also notice the path includes the DNS alias hostname, and not the server\u2019s Active Directory domain name. This is what causes the Kerberos logon failure; there is a bug in the WSUS SDK where the HostHeader registry value is ignored (if configured) and WSUS tries to reach out to theUpdateServicesPackagesshared folder using the host\u2019s alias in the path (via theServerCertificateNameregistry value). Note:WSUS writes date times to SoftwareDistribution.log always in UTC, irrespective of your server\u2019s configured time zone. At the same time as the above, you will also see theevent ID 4625 on the WSUS server\u2019s security event logalso for logon failures. If all the conditions above are the same for you, it\u2019s highly likely this article can help you and either of the proposed solutions below will fix the issue. Note:Whichever solution you decide, ultimately, the choice of solution is a matter of personal preference. Patch My PC does not have any recommendation or preference which you should consider. Solution 1: Reconfigure your WSUS HTTPS config to match the AD FQDN address This solution is choice one of two; and focuses on reconfiguring your WSUS server to use a HTTPS configuration and certificate with a domain matching its AD domain name (or its own hostname, if it\u2019s not domain joined.) Some customers like to implement a DNS alias for their WSUS server because it might be Internet accessible and prefer to keep the URL simple and not expose the server\u2019s internal hostname. If this is your scenario and your WSUS server is domain joined, you may prefer Solution 2 below by configuring aService Principal. To reconfigure WSUS to use the correct hostname and certificate, first, you will need tore-issue your server authentication certificatefrom your trusted Certificate Authority (CA)containing the WSUS server\u2019s FQDN in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN)attribute. Note:This article will not walk you through reissuing your new server authentication certificate, as PKI usage and implementation can vary between environments \u2013 it is recommended you consult your PKI administrator. Once you have the .pfx file for your new certificate (containing the private key), transfer it to the WSUS server and install it in the server\u2019s Local Computer Personal store: Right-click on the start menu and chooseRun\u2026 Typecertlm.mscand press enter ExpandPersonal, right-click onCertificates, and chooseAll Tasks > Import\u2026 Browse out and choose your newly issued certificate .pfx file, and enter the password for the .pfx file (this would have been set at the time of creating the .pfx file.) Thereafter, configure Internet Information Services (IIS) to use this newly imported certificate: Right-click on the start menu and chooseRun\u2026 TypeInetMgr.exeand press enter In theConnectionspane on the left, expand the server >Sites Right-click on theWSUS Administrationsite and chooseEdit Bindings In the dropdown forSSL certificate, choose your new certificate: Next, you need to reconfigure WSUS HTTPS configuration. This will update the ServerCertificateName registry value to that of the correct SAN in your new certificate: Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as administrator Navigate to C:\\Program Files\\Update Services\\Tools Call the WsusUtil.exe to configuressl, setting your server\u2019s AD FQDN address, as per the SAN on your new certificate: Navigate to the below key in the registry and verify the ServerCertificateName value matches the address you entered in the previous step At this point, solution 1 is complete and you should now be able to publish third-party updates successfully into WSUS. You may want to consider the additional follow-up tasks below, which this article will not cover: Updating any GPOs in your domain with the settingSpecify intranet Microsoft update service locationto use your new WSUS server address, e.g.https://FQDN:8531(i.e. the WSUS server\u2019s AD FQDN address.) If you are using ConfigMgr, then you should not need to do this step as ConfigMgr clients automatically set this WSUS local policy with the correct value via its agent. Ensure the endpoints you\u2019re patching with ConfigMgr/WSUS can reach the WSUS server via its FQDN address over ports tcp/8531 and tcp/8530, and the DNS address resolves correctly. Note:it\u2019s possible to also use WSUS with ports tcp/80 and tcp/443, or any other adjacent port numbers. If that\u2019s the case for your WSUS server, then please verify connectivity with those ports instead. Solution 2: Configure a CIFS Service Principle for your WSUS server with your CNAME alias This solution is an alternative option for you to consider which can also resolve the issue. However, for this solution to work, your WSUS servermust be domain-joined, andyou need to be a domain administrator. Log in as a domain administrator on either the WSUS server or Domain Controller (DC) Launch cmd.exe and execute the below command: For example, my alias and ServerCertificateName registry value is wsus.codaamok.lab, and my WSUS server\u2019s Active Directory domain name is cm.codaamok.lab, therefore the command I need to enter is: Finally, you can either reboot the WSUS server, or run the belowklistcommand in an elevated cmd.exe window: At this point, solution 2 is complete and you should now be able to publish third-party updates successfully into WSUS. There are no additional follow-up tasks or considerations required, unlike in solution 1 above.

Patch My PC PublisherAn on-premises application that provides a user-friendly console to automate app publishing in Intune. It leverages an Entra ID App Registration for authentication within your environment. 2. Patch My PC CloudOur cloud-based SaaS solution offers similar functionality to the Publisher, simplifying third-party app publishing. While the Portal is still evolving toward feature parity with the on-premises Publisher, it offers seamless integration using an Enterprise Application (service principal) within Entra ID to securely publish apps. Choosing the Right Solution for GCC High Customers For most customers, both solutions are available, with the SaaS solution often being preferred due to no infrastructure requirements. However, forGCC High customers,Patch My PC Publisheris currently the only compatible option. This is due to the specific restrictions and compliance requirements in GCC High environments, which are not yet supported by our SaaS solution. Why Patch My PC Cloud is Not Compatible with GCC High Environments There are some key factors that prevent our SaaS solution from being used in GCC High environments: In GCC High environments, services like Entra ID and Microsoft Graph use isolated API endpoints unique to the environment. While commercial applications leverage common endpoints likemicrosoftonline.comorgraph.microsoft.com, GCC High requires endpoints specific to its domain, such as*.microsoftonline.us. Curerntly we do not support these GCC High required endpoints. GCC High environments require stringent compliance measures, likeFedRAMP certification. At present, our SaaS solution is notFedRAMPcertified, meaning it does meet the compliance standards for government organizations and contractors working with controlled unclassified information (CUI) and other sensitive data. Summary For organizations operating in GCC High environments,Patch My PC Publisherremains the best and only option for publishing third-party apps to Intune. We are committed to enhancing our SaaS offering to eventually support government cloud environments. If you want to be notified when we do support this, please cast a vote onthis idea.

This post explains why it happens, how Windows Autopilot decides to trigger it, and what you can do to avoid or troubleshoot the reboot issue. Introduction When you deploy a Windows device with Autopilot, you expect the experience to be seamless. However, sometimes, just as the Device Setup phase of Autopilot finishes, the device unexpectedly reboots. ThisAutopilot unexpected rebootinterrupts the expected flow, sending the user back to the sign-in, requiring a second authentication. Even IT admins are caught off guard, and users start asking why they have to sign in twice. This is the classic symptom of what Windows refers to as a coalesced reboot, a planned, consolidated restart triggered by specific Intune policy changes during Autopilot provisioning. Microsoft support teams see the Autopilot unexpected reboot often enough that they published atroubleshooting guideabout it. But what is really happening under the hood, and how can you stop this from breaking your device onboarding experience? Let\u2019s dive in. What Really Triggers an Autopilot Unexpected Reboot The device is not making a random decision when it restarts during Autopilot. TheAutopilot unexpected rebootis triggered by specific Windows logic. At the core are two key pieces: theRebootRequiredURIsand theRebootRequiredregistry key. The first one:RebootRequiredURIs, contains a list of policy URIs that demand a restart. We can find thoseRebootRequiredURIswhen opening the microsoft\\provisioning\\syncml\\RebootRequiredURIs registry key. The second piece is theRebootRequiredregistry key, which serves as the flag that actually causes the system to reboot. This one, we can find in almost the same key:microsoft\\provisioning\\omadm\\syncml\\rebootrequired. In the next section, I\u2019ll walk through how Windows checks these keys during provisioning, how and when the reboot flag is set, and how Autopilot and ESP know to restart the device.. So, how does Windows actually use these keys during provisioning? Let\u2019s break it down. How Windows Decides a Reboot Is Needed When a device receives a new policy during Autopilot (Intune Enrollment), the SyncML engine (omadmclient.exe) processes each policy node. Under the hood, coredpus.dll (initialize function) checks if any of the incoming policy URIs match those listed inHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\SyncML\\RebootRequiredURIs. We can spot this when looking at Procmon: If there is a match, Windows logs an event. You will see Event 2800 in the DeviceManagement Enterprise Diagnostics Provider log, showing that the following URI has triggered a reboot. (The funny.. even with this message logged, it does NOT mean the device will reboot\u2026 believe me\u2026 if not.. well, continue on reading) At the same time, the OMADMClient creates a persistent registry key:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\OMADM\\SyncML\\RebootRequired. This RebootRequired key signals to the rest of the setup process that at least one applied policy requires a restart to take effect. This is what triggers acoalesced reboot, the system restarts, and only then do those particular policy changes become active. It is not about batching every single change, but about ensuring that settings that truly require a reboot are handled correctly. How Autopilot and ESP Execute the Unexpected Reboot With the RebootRequired flag set, control passes to the Enrollment Status Page and the CloudExperienceHost frontend. These components, working together with windows.management.service.dll, check for the presence of the RebootRequired registry key. Please Note: If you want to learn more about how I use the IDA tool to disassemble this code, check out thisPatch N Rant video If the key exists, ESP immediately initiates acoalesced reboot, that is, theAutopilot unexpected rebootthat interrupts the expected single sign-in flow. You will see this restart happen right after device setup and before account setup, just as the user is about to create their Windows Hello PIN (If configured). This behavior is also logged in the Shell Core event log (for example, event62407, mentioning \u2018DeviceSetup RebootCoalescing\u2019). If you are troubleshooting Autopilot unexpected reboots, the next step is understanding what causes these policies to trigger during device setup. The answer lies in how your policies are assigned. Why Device vs. User Policy Assignment Matters TheseAutopilot unexpected rebootsoccur only when the reboot-required policy is assigned to a device group. Device-assigned policies are evaluated and applied during the device setup phase of Autopilot. This means that if a policy matches a URI in RebootRequiredURIs, the reboot is triggered during provisioning. If the device reboots, the authentication buffer it had will be lost, and the user will need to sign in again. If you change the assignment to a user group instead, the same policy will only be applied during the account setup phase, after the user has signed in. At this point, Windows does not perform the same device-wide coalesced reboot, so the disruptive restart does not occur. This is exactly what Microsoft also recommends as a workaround: \u201cA possible workaround is to change the policy assignment from the Device to the User. This still applies the policy and a reboot may still be required for the change to take effect. However, applying the setting after the device phase prevents the coalesced reboot from happening.\u201d This small change in how you target your Intune assignments can be the difference between a double sign-in and a seamless Autopilot experience. But what if you want to test what happens when Windows cannot even signal that a reboot is required? Let\u2019s look at some lab experimentation with permissions\u2026 What Happens If SYSTEM Cannot Set the RebootRequired Key To dig even deeper into theAutopilot unexpected reboot,we tested what happens if Windows loses the ability to set the RebootRequired registry key. We deployed a PowerShell script that places a DENY ACE for \u201cEveryone\u201d on theHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\OMADM\\SyncMLkey. The idea: make it impossible for any account\u2014including SYSTEM\u2014to create new keys or modify anything under this folder. The script removes any existing RebootRequired key, disables inheritance, and adds a DENY for write, delete, or create-subkey operations. Small Note: Don\u2019t deploy this prod\u2026 As I can\u2019t guarantee that nothing else will break. If you are fine with that.. go ahead.. Here\u2019s what the script does: Removes the existing RebootRequired key if it is present. Breaks inheritance on the SyncML key and copies existing ACEs. Adds a DENY entry for Everyone (SID S-1-1-0) to block all write, delete, and create-subkey access. Writes an audit log to confirm the ACL changes. After this script runs, even if a provisioning policy matches something in RebootRequiredURIs, the OMADMClient will be denied access when it wants to set the reboot-required flag. As a result, Autopilot and ESP never receive the signal and simply proceed to account setup as if no coalesced reboot was required (Even while the device management enterprise event log tells us that the policy triggered a reboot). In short, without the \u201cRebootRequired\u201d registry key:no more Autopilot unexpected reboots!!! Again not recommended for production. Here\u2019s the PowerShell script for reference: A Better Way: Audit and Control Your Autopilot Reboot Policies Instead of hacking registry permissions, a smarter approach is to identify which of your policies actually trigger a coalesced reboot, then adjust your assignment strategy accordingly A PowerShell script can help by: Collecting every URI from RebootRequiredURIs Comparing those URIs to the policies in PolicyManager\\current\\device and the PolicyManager nodecache (because that\u2019s where you Intune policies spend their time) Showing which Intune policies are assigned and which are possible triggers for a coalesced reboot Once you know which policies are to blame, best practice is to assign them to a user group rather than a device group. That way, they only apply during account setup, and you avoid theAutopilot unexpected rebootaltogether. Here\u2019s the first version of the script (please reach out if you have any comments or additions) Conclusion If you are dealing with anAutopilot unexpected rebootin your Windows deployment, know that it is not random. These reboots are caused by clear policy logic, registry keys, and device assignments.

If you were not fully invested in JAMF, you were probably writing your own scripts, pushing manual updates, or just hoping Intune would eventually catch up. The good news? Intune has been catching up quickly. Over time, Microsoft has introduced several important improvements for macOS management. But one critical piece is still missing from its patch management features\u2014third party apps, which often become security risks if left unpatched. Patch My PCsolves this by bringing full third party macOS patch management directly into Intune. Intune Is Finally a Real Option for macOS Management This is a major win for IT teams looking to simplify management across Windows and themacOS operating system. For years, Intune was mostly seen as a Windows-only tool while JAMF was the go-to for macOS management. However, Microsoft has steadily added the necessary building blocks to make Intune a viable Mac management platform, especially for organizations that don\u2019t want to manage two separate systems. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new formacOS management: Platform SSOallows seamless authentication across apps and services Declarative Device Management (DDM)delivers faster and more reliable policy enforcement Compliance policies and Conditional Accesshelp secure access to corporate data Support for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)ensures compatibility with the latest Mac hardware Shell script deploymentadds flexibility for app installs and system configuration Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOSdelivers real-time protection Kernel and system extension managementstreamlines permission handling Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)simplifies provisioning through Apple Business Manager But even with these tools, third-party app updates remained outside Intune\u2019s nativepatch managementcapabilities. Closing the Gaps in Intune Mac Patch Management Many IT teams are searching forpatch management softwarethat works seamlessly with Intune\u2014especially for macOS devices, where third-party support has historically lagged behind. With Patch My PC, third-partymacOS patch managementis now integrated with Intune. Admins can deploy and update third-party apps, such as Google Chrome and Zoom, without requiring custom scripts or JAMF. This significantly improves your patch status across your macOS endpoints, making it easier to track and deploycritical security patchesand updates. Whether you\u2019re managing hundreds of Macs or just a handful, this is a scalable, automated way to improve yourpatch managementresults. Deploying macOS Apps with Patch My PC Here\u2019s how Patch My PC Cloud makes third-party macOS patching in Intune simple: Log in to Patch My PC Cloud and open the App Catalog. You\u2019ll now see a list of supported macOS apps that Patch My PC can manage with ease. For example, consider Google Chrome, a browser that updates frequently and requires consistent security patching. Whether it\u2019s performance enhancements or importantbug fixes, staying updated is crucial. Select the Google Chrome browser from the app catalog. Once you select the Google Chrome browser, you can clickDeployunder the macOS section. From there, you will follow the default flow of selecting the assignment and saving the macOS application configuration. This automatically pushes the app configuration to Microsoft Intune and handles the deployment settings behind the scenes. There is no scripting and no manual packaging. Under theDeploymentstab in Patch My PC Cloud, you can monitor the deployment process in real-time. Once deployed, your macOS devices will automatically receive the latest application version, which improves visibility and ensures a healthy patch status across your fleet. With the Google Chrome macOS application being deployed from the Patch My PC Cloud portal, it\u2019s time to verify the application in Intune itself. Go toIntune > Apps > macOS apps, and you\u2019ll seeGoogle Chromelisted as aPKG deployment. With Patch My PC handling the packaging and patching process, Intune takes over responsibility for delivering updates to your managed macOS devices. Why MSPs Should Care About Intune Mac Patch Management While many Managed Service Providers (MSPs) support clients with Windows devices, they may need to maintain a number of macOS devices as well. Until now, keeping those devices updated meant patching them manually, leaving them unpatched, or maintaining a separate JAMF setup just for a few third-party macOS apps. Patch My PC has addressed this by enabling MSPs to consolidate Windows and Mac third-party app patch management on a single platform. This has streamlined macOS patch management by reducing manual work and making app updates easier to manage at scale, while also simplifying the overall patching process, improving client reporting, and providing clearer visibility into patch status across all tenants. By automating Mac patch management within Intune, MSPs can reduce overhead while enhancing client security and minimizing the risk of security vulnerabilities associated with outdated software. With Patch My PC\u2019s macOS support, MSPs can: Patch both Windows and macOS apps from a single interface Manage multiple tenants efficiently from one portal Improvepatch statusvisibility across all customer environments Reducesecurity vulnerabilitiesby keeping third-party apps up to date Focus onautomating patch managementinstead of relying on manual processes Patch My PC for MSPsis built withmulti-tenant macOS patch managementin mind. It enables consistent update delivery across customers, reduces compliance risks, and saves time on day-to-day operations. For businesses that rely on MSPs, this means stronger endpoint protection, fewer service interruptions, and faster app updates, all without adding overhead to internal IT.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-device-preparation-bitlocker-256-bit-issue/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Fixing the Autopilot (AP-DP) BitLocker 256-Bit Issue In this blog, we\u2019ll look at theAutopilot BitLocker 256-bit issue, a problem where devices start encrypting with 128-bit encryption during Autopilot Device Preparation, even when 256-bit encryption is required. It\u2019s been a real challenge for environments that enforce stronger policies through Intune. A new Windows feature in the latest Insider build seemed to finally solve the issue, but it came with its own problems. The Autopilot Device Preparation 256-bit BitLocker Issue One of the outstanding issues in Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) is thatBitLocker encryptionactivatesbeforethe Intune policy has a chance to enforce stronger encryption settings. Even Microsoft documents this behavior under known issues: \u201cBitLocker encryption defaults to 128-bit when 256-bit encryption is configured.\u201d By default, Windows automatically starts encrypting the disk with XTS-AES 128-bit encryption during OOBE, which occurs immediately after the user logs in and just before the Intune policy sync is completed. Which corresponds with Microsoft\u2019s official documentation, as shown below. But\u2026 If you configured a BitLocker policy requiring XTS AES 256-bit BitLocker Encryption, you\u2019re already noncompliant.. and pretty much screwed! (if using AP-DP or the regular OOBE experience) The only option we had when using AP-DP in combination with a 256-bit encryption requirement was to run a PowerShell script after/during enrollment to decrypt and re-encrypt the device. But that\u2019s just a workaround for something that Windows should have handled from the start. In a recent Windows Insider build, we found signs that Microsoft is finally addressing this. A new feature attempts to defer BitLocker until policy sync has finished, but enabling it came with a side effect: the \u201cNext\u201d button stopped working during enrollment. A New Feature Appears: Autopilot BitLocker Deferral While working on something else using theIDA tool, we spotted a new feature ID in the system:29240126. It was labeled\u2018Autopilot BitLocker Oobe Deferral\u2019. If you want to know more how we figured out this Feature in the BitLocker code, you may want to watch this episode of Patch N Rant Patch N Rant Episode 3 The BitlockerOobeDeferral name was promising and appeared to address theAP-DP256 bit BitLocker issue (not the escrow issue we discussed here). So, we decided to take a closer look. What we found was a change in the encryption logic inside fveapi.dll. (Full Volume Encryption.) which is responsible for BitLocker encryption. This Autopilot BitLocker Oobe Deferral feature adds logic to delay BitLocker automatic encryption until the MDM policy sync has completed. It does so without relying on the Enrollment Status Page to hold back encryption (because AP-DP is a bit different from Autopilot). Let\u2019s do a deep dive into the code.. How the Autopilot Bitlocker Deferral Feature Works Internally When Windows starts the BitLocker encryption, it calls: CFveApi::InitializeDeviceEncryption() This function checks whether it\u2019s safe to start encryption by calling: FveIsOOBECompleted() Under normal conditions, that check returns true if the system sees that OOBE is complete. It does that by checking the WNF stateWNF_SHEL_OOBE_USER_LOGON_COMPLETEor registry values like SetupDisplayedEula. With Feature 29240126 enabled, it performs an extra check. InsideFveIsOOBECompleted(),it now calls: FveShouldDeferForMdmPolicySync() That function looks for two conditions: Is the device in an Autopilot provisioning scenario Has MDM policy sync completed, indicated by the WNF flag: WNF_PROV_AUTOPILOT_PROVISIONING_BITLOCKER_DEFERRAL_COMPLETE Only when both checks pass does BitLocker start. If either fails, encryption is deferred. This allows the system to receive and apply the 256-bit encryption policy from Intune before writing any data to disk. Testing the Behavior with ViVeTool We enabled the feature manually using ViVeTool and then enrolled the device with an Intune BitLocker policy configured to enforceXTS AES 256-bit encryption. In a typical scenario, without the BitLocker OOBE Deferral fix, Windows would begin encrypting automatically duringOOBE using the default 128-bit method. By the time the Intune policy arrives, it\u2019s already too late, the drive is partially encrypted, compliance fails, and the only solution is to decrypt and re-encrypt. With Feature 29240126 enabled, that behavior changed. BitLocker did not start during OOBE or Autopilot Device Preparation. The device waited until the Intune MDM policy was received and processed successfully. As shown below, BitLocker encryption was indeed deferred entirelythe moment the user logged in for the first time. From there on, after the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment was completed successfully, the BitLocker encryption should now kick in with the 256-bit BitLocker policy in place. At least, that\u2019s what we were hoping for. However, we never got that far because the enrollment couldn\u2019t even be completed. The \u201cNext\u201d button on the Device Preparation Page was visible, but clicking it did absolutely nothing. What happened? Let\u2019s examine the Shell Core Log first to gain a better understanding of it. What the Shell-Core Event Log told us After clicking the \u201cNext\u201d button, we checked the Shell-Core event logs (They hold Information about what happens with the CloudExperienceHost OOBE). The logs confirmed the click event was registered, but the page failed during its exit sequence. Here\u2019s what was captured: 1. Next Button ClickedDevicePrepPage_NextButtonClicked_StartedConfirms that the click handler was triggered correctly. 2. Reboot Resumption UnsetDevicePrepPage_RebootResumption_UnsetAutopilot_DevicePreparationPage_unsetResumeToCurrentPageAsyncSucceededThe system clears the resume-to-this-page-on-reboot flag, as expected. 3. ExitPageAsync StartsDevicePrepPage_ExitPageAsyncLogs a call tosetPageStatusAsyncWith value 3. 4. Instance Null on GetDevicePrepPage_autopilotDevicePreparationUtilitiesInstance_getOrCreateWinRtInstanceHelperAsync_instanceNullThe JS logic fails to get a valid instance ofautopilotDevicePreparationUtilitiesInstance. 5. WinRT Instance Creation AttemptDevicePrepPage_autopilotDevicePreparationUtilitiesInstance_createWinRtInstanceHelperAsync_StartedThe system attempts to create the required WinRT instance. 6. Instance Creation FailsDevicePrepPage_autopilotDevicePreparationUtilitiesInstance_createWinRtInstanceHelper_FailedError code:-2130464756(0x80D07014/MDM_E_DEVICE_PREPARATION_UTILITIES_FAILED)The WinRT instance creation fails completely, preventing the page from progressing. This log sequence aligned exactly with the behavior we observed: the UI became unresponsive at the\u201cNext\u201dstep, and the only way forward was to resolve the underlying issue\u2026 but how? I decided to find out if the BitLocker Deferral feature was the one causing the issue. Verifying the Root Cause To confirm that Feature 29240126 was the cause of the issue, we first enabled it to ensure the device wouldnotautomatically start encrypting during Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE). That part worked exactly as expected. BitLocker waited/deferred. But since the\u201cNext\u201dbutton in the Device Preparation Page refused to respond, we needed a way to isolate the cause. So, we created a PowerShell script that disables the BitLocker deferral feature using ViVeTool. We uploaded this script to Intune and added it to the list ofrequired scriptsthat must run duringAutopilot Device Preparation. Once the device progressed through the initial phases and the Intune Management Extension (IME) was installed, the script was executed as part of the provisioning flow. After the script completed and the feature was disabled, we clicked \u201cNext\u201d, and the page finally responded. From there on, we finally could find out if the AES256 Bitlocker policy was going to kick in. Once we logged in, we opened PowerShell and executed theget-bitlockervolume | FLcommand. As shown below, the Autopilot Device Preparation Device was now automatically being encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption. Besides checking the device, we also checked Intune. As shown below, no errors! No conflicts! Just a working 256-bit BitLocker policy. Disabling the Autopilot Bitlocker OOBE Deferral feature just before the Required Setup is complete page appeared, confirmed that the BitLocker deferral feature was directly responsible for breaking the navigation logic in the Device Preparation Page. With this information, I moved over to look at the Autopilot Device Preparation Javascript code, which was responsible for the flow. The UI Is Just Code Before diving into the exact cause, it\u2019s important to understand what we\u2019re dealing with. The Device Preparation Page in Autopilot isn\u2019t a native compiled binary or some deeply integrated part of Windows. It\u2019s just HTML and JavaScript, specifically the fileautopilotDevicePreparation-page.vm.js, running inside a WebView App during OOBE. That JS file controls exactly what happens when buttons like \u201cNext\u201d are clicked. It handles telemetry, WinRT calls, and transition logic. And if one of those calls fails without proper error handling, the entire flow breaks. The Root Cause: Missing Error Handling Inside the file autopilotDevicePreparation-page.vm.js, we found the cause. When the BitLocker deferral feature is enabled, the page calls: signalBitlockerProvisioningComplete(3) This function is used to notify the system that BitLocker provisioning has completed or was skipped. But it was called without any try-catch block, it seems. If the call failed, the page never transitioned to the success state. The Fix: Patch the JavaScript Before Enrollment Before triggering the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment again, we manually edited the fileautopilotDevicePreparation-page. vm.js on the system.This required taking ownership of the file and assigning write permissions to it. After changing the permissions, we modified the code to wrap the BitLocker signal call with a try-catch block: With this in place, even if the BitLocker signal failed, the page continued totransitionToSuccessPageAsync(). We kicked off the enrollment again, and the result was clear: the \u201cNext\u201d button was functional and working again. The Device Preparation Page exited cleanly. BitLocker still waited for the policy, and no manual re-encryption was needed. Feel free to watch the full video https://youtu.be/rfMNtOzU2NI Upon reviewing the Shell-Core event log again, it confirmed that the fix had been applied: DevicePrepPage_ExitPageAsync \u201cDevicePrepPage: Calling setPageStatusAsync with 3\u201d, \u201cerrorCode\u201d: 0 Will We Get Control Over This? Right now, there\u2019s no real control over how this BitLocker deferral feature works. No CSP. No toggle in the Autopilot profile. Just a hidden feature ID you have to enable with ViVeTool. Ideally, we\u2019d get a setting inside the Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) profile to turn this on or off, just like you\u2019d expect with any platform-level change. However, even if Microsoft adds that setting, there is still a problem, the BitLocker decision happensbefore thedevice is fully enrolled. So, unless the OS knows up front that the feature should be active, it\u2019s already too late. Automatic encryption is activated as soon as the user logs in to the desktop. That means either: Microsoft makes this the new default behavior for AP-DP Or they need a way to apply this logicbeforeMDM takes over (Device Linking?) Until we know how they\u2019ll handle that, this feature sits in a grey area: promising, but not yet manageable. Autopilot Bitlocker Final Thoughts Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) didn\u2019t previously support BitLocker deferral the way classic Autopilot (v1) did. That\u2019s now changing. Feature 29240126 introduces logic to delay BitLocker encryption until after Intune MDM policy sync, using a WNF signal as the trigger. The backend logic worked, but the frontend did not? It appears that a try-catch block was missing in the Device Preparation Page JavaScript, which caused the \u201cNext\u201d button to malfunction. Once we patched the JS file ourselves, the next button started working, and BitLocker waited until the user signed in before starting encryption, this time with the correct 256-bit encryption method applied The feature isn\u2019t exposed through Intune or CSP yet, and there\u2019s no reliable way to control it during early provisioning. BitLocker deferral is finally making its way into AP DP, and it\u2019s getting close to working as expected.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/powershell-scripts-not-executing-maxjsonlength/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune PowerShell Scripts Failing? Check MaxJsonLength Are your PowerShell scripts not executing on newly enrolled Intune devices?You are probably not the only one.The root cause may be a bit funny. When the Intune Management Extension (SideCar) sends its initial policy request, the payload can exceed themaxJsonLengthlimit used byJavaScriptSerializer. When that happens, the PowerShell scripts will never come down to your device\u2026 PowerShell Scripts not executing It started with a tag onReddit.Not long after, I was contacted by multiple different companies experiencing the same thing. IT Admins were running into the same issue: brand new Intune-enrolled devices where thePowerShell platform scripts simply didn\u2019t run. The Win32 apps installed fine. Detection scripts were executed successfully. Even proactive remediations seem to work. But the PowerShell scripts (Platform scripts)? Nothing. The Intune portal showed no execution history, no success or errors, just alot of nothing. It was as if thePowerShell scriptswere never getting deployed at all. Was it an assignment issue or something else? Well, I was bound to find out. The Issue Our tests confirmed it. Existing devices had no problem processing existing PowerShell scripts. But new devices, especially freshly enrolled ones, weren\u2019t running any PowerShell scripts delivered via the Intune Management Extension. The Intune Management Extension (IME) would install as usual, Win32 apps and their detection scripts executed successfully, and remediation scripts (triggered via get-scripts) also worked. But PowerShell platform scripts were completely skipped\u2026 which felt weird. The IME Logs: MaxJsonLength Initially, we dove into the usual Intune Management Extension log we need to use when we are troubleshooting PowerShell issues: the AgentExecutor log. Well\u2026. that log contained nothing usefull! No evidence of PowerShell script execution at all. But the IntuneManagementExtension.log had something more useful. Just after successfully sending a web request to the SideCar gateway, a new line appeared just before it went silent: [PowerShell] Exception occurs when processing user session\u2026 Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSONJavaScriptSerializer.The Length of the string exceeds the value set on the MaxJsonLength Property. The error clearly referenced the maxJsonLength property, which was our first real clue. MaxJsonLength told us that the JSON string had reached its maximum length, which literally broke the Intune Management Extension PowerShell script\u2019s execution. I decided to dig deeper. Capturing IME traffic with Fiddler At first, we thought we could intercept the SideCar policy request usingFiddler. We installed Fiddler and enabled HTTPS decryption (check out our webinar to find out how to set it up!). But the moment we hit the SideCar endpoint (manage.microsoft.com), the IME gateway rejected us with a 401 Forbidden/Unauthorized. The WebRequest call broke because it expected a trusted certificate that corrosponds withagents.amsub0302.manage.microsoft.comrequest. Of course this could solved pretty easily\u2026How? Well, check out the video series called Patch and Rant that will discuss this in more detail and how to fix it. As shown below it\u2019s pretty easy to capture the IME traffic but I wanted to find out more. The PowerShell Script Plugin IME Flow After capturing the IME traffic with Fiddler, we moved on. This time, we started looking at the IME decompiled code. After decompiling the IME ScriptPlugIn.dll with the dotpeek tool, we focused on the PowerShellScriptPlugIn logic. Here\u2019s how the full PowerShell Script Plugin flow works: The IME starts its polling cycle It fetches the current AAD session IDs and prepares to check in It uses the device\u2019s MDM certificate (retrieved via GetMDMCertWithRetry) and attaches it to the request A SideCar Gateway Session object is built The request uses the content type PolicyRequest (at first, I thought it would use the GetScript content type\u2026. but I guess I was totally wrong) The IME serializes (converts) the policy result data using the JavaScriptSerializer The serialized string is included as the request payload The request is sent via a PUT to the SideCar gateway endpoint: /SideCarGatewayService/SideCarGatewaySessions At this point, if the serialized JSON payload exceeds the configured maxJsonLength on the IME service side, deserialization fails. The server returns nothing. The IME logs an exception, and no PowerShell scripts are delivered. Rebuilding the PowerShell Policy Request in PowerShell We wanted to validate this behavior ourselves, so we built a PowerShell script that mimicked the IME behavior. Yes, we built a PowerShell script to communicate with the IME service and fetch the policy ourselves! By using Fiddler previously, we first captured a working session and copied over the session ID, request key, and bearer token. (The AccountId/DeviceID were already mentioned in the IME log) With the PowerShell script finished, it was ready for a testdrive to find out if we could run into the same MaxJsonLength error. Reproducing the MaxJsonLength error From there, the custom PowerShell script executed a manual PUT request to the SideCar endpoint, using the same headers and including the same payload structure to start the policy request (PowerShell scripts). At first, we skipped the JavaScriptSerializer. And it worked!! (after spending some time on it to get it working) The response came back successfully with the full set of assigned PowerShell policies, around 3.7 MB. The JSON file itself was even bigger (7 MB). That indeed contained all the base64-encrypted PowerShell scripts that we configured. Then we rebuilt the script to serialize the payload exactly the way the IME does using JavaScriptSerializer. That\u2019s when the response gave the exact same error as we noticed in the Intune Management Extension log. As shown earlier, we added a JSON size check to our PowerShell script to pinpoint the issue. Then, we started removing one PowerShell script from Intune, one by one\u2026 and waiting a cloud minute. After each PowerShell/Platform script that we removed from Intune, we restarted the IME and re-ran our PowerShell script to check if the request succeeded. Eventually (after removing like 5/6 scripts), when the total serialized payload dropped below the magical 2 MB threshold, the request succeeded. IME stopped throwing errors, and the PowerShell scripts showed up in theIME logsagain. This proved it. Once the Intune PolicyPayload size was under the limit of 2 MB, the IME completed the round trip and acknowledged the PowerShell script policies. But the question still remains: Why is this happening suddenly, and why are people somehow experiencing this issue when nothing changed on their side? What Changed? After doing some research and looking at older traces, we got\u2026 we noticed something different in the PolicyRequest Payload. If I am not mistaken, in the past, we only had thePolicyBody(PowerShell scripts in plain text) coming down in the ResponsePayload when the IME needed to fetch the PowerShell script policies. Nowadays (changed with the 2505 Intune Release?), we also have theencryptedpolicybodycoming down in the JSON? So I decided to create another PowerShell script that mimics the IMEEncryptionHelper(Decrypt) function\u2026 (why not?) Examining how that function retrieves the Intune MDM Device certificate to decode it made things a bit easier. I converted the IME Function to a PowerShell script to decode that information. Guess what that Powershell script showed me when I executed it! Yes!! Exactly, the exact same PowerShell script we noticed in thePolicyBodyitself, but this time encrypted. It looks like Microsoft added theEncryptedPolicyBodyto thePolicyRequest(PowerShell scripts IME Policy). With it, the whole JSON got at least two times bigger. With the JSON getting two times bigger\u2026 guess what happened? Exactly, the JSON exceeded 2MB, and with it, we got the error: The Length of the string exceeds the value set on theMaxJsonLengthProperty. When we get this error, no PowerShell scripts will be deployed to our devices. So if you are stumbling into this issue, you know where to start looking! 8. Fixing the MaxJsonLength We need Microsoft\u2019s Intune service team to raise the allowed JSON payload size by setting maxJsonLength in their web config. I expect Microsoft to eventually move away from the plaintextPolicyBodyand only retain theEncryptedPolicyBody.Until then, if your PowerShell scripts aren\u2019t running out of the sudden, start checking their combined payload size. You might be silently hitting the threshold wall. Conclusion If your PowerShell scripts aren\u2019t running on newly enrolled Intune devices, you\u2019re likely hitting the maxJsonLength limit. The recent addition of the encryptedPolicyBody doubled the payload size, pushing it past the 2MB threshold.The Intune Management Extension fails silently, no scripts, no logs, just nothing.Until Microsoft raises the limit, keep an eye on how much you\u2019re pushing down Free Trial Schedule Demo Schedule a Setup Call Schedule a Q&A Call ROI Calculator Advanced Insights Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC Publisher Home Updater CVE Insights PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) MEM Patching Optimizer About Us Careers Events & Webinars Customer Reviews Contact Us Call Us: 1 800 250 2334 FAQs Knowledge Base Catalog Release History Product Documentation Release Notes Partners & Resellers Feature Request Product Roadmap Patch Tuesday Blog Patch My PC Blog Support Forum Supported Products"}
{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-autopilot-pre-provisioning-bypasses-restrictions/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows Autopilot Pre-Provisioning Bypasses Enrollment Restrictions? This blog explores whyIntune Platform enrollment restrictionsdon\u2019t always block outdated Windows versions, when you configured an additional policy. Many assume assigning it to all users will prevent enrollment, butWindows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments bypasses user-based restrictions entirely. We\u2019ll break down why this happens and how toproperly enforce OS version blocks in all enrollment scenarios. Introduction to the Platform Enrollment Restrictions Let\u2019s say, you have configured anadditional Device Platform Enrollment restriction policyin Intune to block outdated Windows versions from enrolling instead of using the Default one. Once the additional platform restriction is created, you assigned it to all users, double-checked the settings, and expected everything to work as planned. As shown below, we configured the platform restriction to require a min Windows version of 10.0.0.22621. But somehow, devices with outdated Windows builds are still showing up in Intune? They\u2019re fully enrolled and managed, even though they clearly don\u2019t meet theOS version requirement.With it they should have been blocked, right? You check the platform restriction policy again, and everything looks correct. So why isn\u2019t Intune enforcing the restriction as expected? The Assumption: Additional Enrollment Restrictions Apply Everywhere When auser-driven Windows Autopilot enrollmenthappens, the assumption is that as soon as the user signs in and the device starts enrolling into Intune, theOS version Platform restrictionswill be checked. If the device is running an unsupported build, enrollment will be blocked immediately. But that\u2019s not exactly how it works. What Happens in a User-Driven Enrollment: The user reaches theEntra ID authentication screenand logs in. The device isEntra ID joined. Intune enrollment startsafter the Entra join is complete. At this point,Intune checks the assigned platform enrollment restrictionsfor the user. If the OS version does not meet the requirement, the enrollment process stops, and the device is never fully enrolled in Intune, causing Windows Autopilot enrollment to fail. That\u2019s where enrollment restrictions come into play. Theydon\u2019t apply at the Entra ID join stagebut rather at the moment the device attempts to enroll in Intune after the join iscomplete. But what if a device enrollswithouta user signing in at all? That\u2019s exactly what happens inWindows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments, and that\u2019s where things get interesting. Windows Autopilot Enrollment: User-Driven vs. Pre-Provisioned Deployments There are two ways a device can enroll in Intune via Windows Autopilot: User-Driven Enrollment\u2013 The user logs in, the device joins Entra ID, and when Intune enrollment starts, it checks if the OS version restriction applies to the user. If the version is below the minimum, the enrollment will be blocked. Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments\u2013 The device enrolls intoEntra ID and Intune before any user logs in, usingTPM attestation and the Autopilot@ or \u201cfoo\u201d userto authenticate itself to Intune. Because Pre-Provisioned Deployments happen without a real user sign-in, Intune never checks user-based enrollment restrictions. The deviceauthenticates at the hardware level, meaning any additionaluser-targetedplatform restrictions are bypassed. This is why outdated Windows versions are still enrolling, even though you configured an additional enrollment restriction. Since there isno user context at enrollment, the additional enrollment restriction isn\u2019t evaluated, and Intune allows the process to be completed. The Default Enrollment Restriction Policy: The Only Way to Block Pre-Provisioned Deployments If you want to prevent outdated Windows versions from enrolling in all scenarios, including Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments, you NEED to configure the default platform restriction policy instead. Unlike additional policies that only apply when a user signs in, the default policy is enforced as soon as the device contacts Intune for enrollment! https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set As shown above, Intune enforces the default policy in enrollment scenarios that aren\u2019t user-driven! This means: It enforces OS version restrictionseven when Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments is used. Pre-Provisioned Deployments cannot bypass it.If an OS version is blocked in the default policy, the device is prevented from enrolling before the process even starts. User-driven enrollments still respect it, so the restriction applies regardless of whether a user is present or not. If you only configure anadditional user-based enrollment restrictionand leave thedefault oneuntouched, Pre-Provisioned Deployments will ignore the restriction entirely. That\u2019s why outdated devices are still enrolling. How to Actually Block Old Windows Versions If you want to ensure that outdated Windows versionsnever enroll, no matter the scenario, you must: Edit the default enrollment restriction policy in Intune. Set a minimum OS version for Windows under platform restrictions. Save the policy and ensure it applies to all devices. Once this is configured, Intune will enforce the OS version check in both Windows Autopilot user-driven enrollment and Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments. With this restriction in place, the enrollment will be blocked! Conclusion If you assumed that assigning anadditional enrollment restriction policyto all users would block outdated devices from enrolling, now you know why it didn\u2019t work.Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployments completely ignores user-targeted platform device enrollment restrictionsbecause there\u2019s no user context at enrollment. The only way to enforce OS version restrictions at all stages of enrollment, whether user-driven or pre-provisioned, is bymodifying the default enrollment restriction policy. If it\u2019s not set correctly, outdated devices will continue to slip through, regardless of additional restrictions.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/personal-data-encryption-protected-data-asro-setting/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The Hidden ARSO Setting That Breaks Personal Data Encryption This blog is about a security detail in Windows 11 that is easy to miss. If you use Personal Data Encryption but do not disable theAutomatic Restart Sign On (ARSO)policy, your files are not as protected as you think. I will show you what ARSO is, why it matters, and the steps Microsoft does not highlight, but you need to know. Introduction Personal Data Encryption in Windows 11is designed to secure the user\u2019s/personal files. The goal is that only you, the actual user, can access important folders, such as Desktop, Documents, and Pictures, provided you useWindows Hello for Businessto sign in. Microsoft says a password alone should never get you access to the data. And\u2026 believe me, Microsoft mentions it a lot of times But there is a catch. To get this level of protection, you must meet every requirement for Personal Data Encryption. If you miss just one, Windows quietly falls back to weaker security. The most common mistake? Forgetting to disable a background feature called Automatic Restart Sign On. What Personal Data Encryption Needs To Work Personal Data Encryption is not just a checkbox. It needs several things in place to provide real protection: You must enable Personal Data Encryption for the user folders you want to protect. Windows Hello for Business must be set up. That means your users need to sign in with a PIN or biometrics, never just a password. And here is the one most people forget:you must disable Automatic Restart Sign On. What Is Automatic Restart Sign On (ARSO) and Why Does It Matter Automatic Restart Sign On, also known as ARSO, is a Windows feature that is usually invisible to end users. Its main purpose is to help Windows finish updates. After a restart, ARSO automatically signs in the last user account so Windows can finish setting up updates or features in the background. The session is locked right away, so no one else can use the desktop, but tasks can still run. Here is the problem. ARSO uses stored credentials, which could include just the user\u2019s password. This means after a reboot, Windows might use a password behind the scenes to finish signing in, not your PIN or fingerprint. That is enough to break the security promise of Personal Data Encryption. If ARSO is not set to Disabled, Windows cannot guarantee you signed in with Windows Hello for Business. So, to avoid breaking the system, Windows silently switches to a fallback encryption method. The funny thing? ASRO is enabled by default! With this policy being automatically enabled by default, we NEED to disable it with a separate settings catalog! Why Does Windows Switch To Data Protection API (DPAPI) When ARSO is enabled, the device cannot enforce the requirement that you must use Windows Hello for Business. As a result, Windows stops using Personal Data Encryption for new files and falls back to the standard Data Protection API. Data Protection APIis the built-in Windows encryption system that protects data for a user account. It makes sure that only the same user can open encrypted files. But it does not care how you sign in. You could use a password, a PIN, a FIDO key, or biometrics; any of these will work. This is less secure than Personal Data Encryption, which is supposed to require a stronger sign-in. What Happens If You Miss The Automatic Restart Sign On Setting If you enable Personal Data Encryption but forget to disable ARSO: You will still see the yellow lock icon on your files, which looks like everything is protected. The lock screen will even tell you to use a PIN for access. Local admin accounts are still blocked from opening these files, so it seems secure. But here is the issue: as the regular user, you can still open your files with just your password. When looking closer at the real protection status by looking at the properties of the file, you will notice that the Personal Data Encryption is off, even while everything else indicates that PDE is enabled What is really happening is that Windows has quietly stopped using Personal Data Encryption and is now using the weaker Data Protection API. The change is invisible unless you actually test it. How To Set Up Personal Data Encryption Correctly If you want real protection from Personal Data Encryption, follow these steps: Make sure Windows Hello for Business is fully set up for your users. Use a policy to enable Personal Data Encryption on the folders you want to protect. Create a separate policy to disable ARSO.In Group Policy, go to Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Logon Options, and look for Sign in and lock last interactive user automatically after a restart. Set this to Disabled.In Intune, use the Settings Catalog. Search for Winlogon automatic restart sign on and set it to Disabled. In Group Policy, go to Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Logon Options, and look for Sign in and lock last interactive user automatically after a restart. Set this to Disabled. In Intune, use the Settings Catalog. Search for Winlogon automatic restart sign on and set it to Disabled. If you do not set ARSO to Disabled, your users will always be able to open protected files with just a password, and you will not receive the expected security. Why This Automatic Restart Sign On Detail Is So Easy To Miss The ARSO policy is not included in the standard Endpoint Security template for Personal Data Encryption in Intune. You have to know about it and create an extra policy just for ARSO. While Microsoft does mention in their requirements that ARSO should be disabled, they do not explain what actually happens if you skip this step. There is no clear warning that leaving ARSO enabled means Windows will quietly fall back to using Data Protection API. This fallback allows users to access protected files with just a password, which defeats the purpose of Personal Data Encryption. Because of this, even careful administrators can think they are protected, when in reality, users are only getting standard encryption, not the extra layer tied to Windows Hello for Business. Microsoft Needs To Fix This This ASRO step is too easy to forget.In my opion, Microsoft should update their documentation to make the ARSO requirement impossible to miss. Even better, the ARSO setting should be added directly to the Endpoint Security settings for Personal Data Encryption in Intune. If this were part of the default template, fewer organizations would make this mistake and believe their files are safe when they are not. Conclusion Personal Data Encryption can only protect your files as promised if ARSO is Disabled.If you leave ARSO enabled (which is the default setting), Windows will automatically revert to using the standard Data Protection API. That means a password will always be enough to get into your supposedly protected files. So, whenever you set up Personal Data Encryption, double-check the ARSO policy. This is the hidden step that makes the difference between real security and just a locked icon.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-device-preparation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Autopilot Device Preparation: The Standard User Fix This blog covers how Microsoft implemented a fix in the Intune Management Extension (IME) to address the standard user bug in Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP). The issue caused users to remain in the local Administrators group when they should have been demoted to standard users. Introduction In Autopilot Device Preparation, IT admins configure the device preparation policies to define whether the enrolling user should be a local administrator or a standard user. This setting is enforced by StandardUserProvider, a component within the Intune Management Extension (IME) that ensures users are removed from the local Administrators group when required.This setting is enforced by StandardUserProvider, a component within the Intune Management Extension (IME) that ensures users are removed from the local Administrators group when required. However, as highlighted in this previous blog, StandardUserProvider frequently failed to execute, leaving users as local administrators when they should have been *demoted. *: The user becomes an Admin during Entra join (depending on the Entra settings) and would be demoted to a standard user once the IME is installed. The Root Cause: Why Did Standard User Provider Fail? Language-Specific Group Names Caused Lookup Failures StandardUserProvider originally attempted to find the \u201cAdministrators\u201d group using a hardcoded English name: using (GroupPrincipal byIdentity = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, \u201cAdministrators\u201d)) On non-English systems, the Administrators group might be named \u201cAdministratoren\u201d (German), \u201cAdministrateurs\u201d (French), etc. Since \u201cAdministrators\u201d didn\u2019t exist in those languages, the lookup failed, preventing the user from being removed. No Fallback or Error Logging If the lookup failed, StandardUserProvider didn\u2019t attempt a secondary method. There were no logs explaining why the removal process was skipped. As a result, users retained administrator privileges, even when the provisioning profile required standard user status. The Fix: Switching to a SID-Based Approach With the latest IME update, Microsoft replaced name-based lookups with a SID-based method, ensuring Standard User Provider functions reliably across all languages. How IME Fixed Standard User Provider Using a SID-Based Lookup (Language-Independent) Instead of searching by name, IME now finds the Administrators group using its well-known SID: (which makes 100% sense!) S-1-5-32-544 is the universal SID for the Administrators group, consistent across all languages.This ensures that Standard User Provider always finds the correct group, regardless of the system\u2019s language settings. 2.Extracting the User SID from ExecutionContext JSON Previously, StandardUserProvider assumed the correct user SID was passed but didn\u2019t verify it. The fix now ensures it dynamically retrieves the user SID from ExecutionContext JSON: When we open the execution context ourselves, we can spot the same thing. If the user SID is missing, the process now logs an explicit reason instead of failing silently. 3.Enhanced Logging and Telemetry IME now logs every action in the bootstrapper event log, providing better visibility into execution flow and failures: If the group lookup fails, logs now capture the exact reason instead of skipping execution. New Execution Flow in Standard User Provider With the updated IME logic, StandardUserProvider now follows this structured execution flow in which the removeuserfromadmingroup method is added and plays an important role: Remove User From Admin Group Method As we noticed in the flow above, the real power to remove the user from the admin group lies in this newly added method! 1.The Fix in RemoveUserFromAdminGroup The core logic for removing the user from the Administrators group now follows a SID-based method, ensuring language independence and consistent execution. With this new approach, the user is removed from the local administrators group! 2.IME Version with the Fix This fix is included in IME version: Fixed: 1.87.101.0 Old (Broken): 1.86.101.0 Conclusion With this IME update, Autopilot Device Preparation now properly enforces Standard User configurations, ensuring users are reliably removed from the local Administrators group, regardless of system language. By shifting from a name-based lookup to a SID-based approach, Microsoft now fixed the local administrator bug, ensuring StandardUserProvider functions reliably across different languages and locales.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/data-breach-prevention-remediation-guide/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Data Breach Prevention and Remediation: A Guide to Prevention Now and Remediation When the Inevitable Occurs With theCrowdStrike fiascoplaying out in real-time in July 2024, companies around the world are taking cyber security seriously. And they should. Data breaches are one of the costliest parts of doing business. In fact, data breaches in general are on the rise. AT&T, Dell, and Bank of America are onlya few high-profile examplesof companies that experienced a data breach in 2024. Plus, another3,200 breaches occurredin the US with1 billion victimsbetween 2023 and 2024. And in 2023, businesses around the world paid a collective$1 billion to ransomware gangs. What is a data breach? A data breach happens when sensitive information (whether of a company or of a customer) is exposed in any way due to a bad actor or company negligence. Why do data breaches happen? Data breaches happen because sensitive data, especially corporate data and customer data, are so lucrative. There\u2019s a lot of money in selling sensitive information and confidential information to either competitors, advertisers, or additional bad actors. In recent years, in fact, it\u2019s become apparent that bad actors combine forces and systematically target companies for financial gain. Ransomware as a service (RaaS) businesses arenow listed officially on the FBI watchlists. In fact, ransomware attackers hold sensitive data hostage until a payment is made or threaten to leak data on the internet, or worse the dark web. Companies are forced to shell out $250,000 USD for theaverage ransomware paymentin the US. That may not seem like much to large corporations, but for small businesses the financial losses can spell disaster. What businesses do data breaches happen to? The short answer: all businesses. No company, no business, no person is safe from a data breach incident. No matter how large or small, every company that operates and every person with sensitive data is susceptible to a data breach. What companies and industries are most susceptible to a data breach? Although corporate data breaches are in the news every day, small businesses are actually the most at risk for data breach attempts. Other high-risk industries, such as healthcare companies, include those that store large amounts of financial information and personal identifiable information. This information is extremely lucrative. Bad actors know companies will pay a premium to protect customer information in a ransomware attack and if the company doesn\u2019t comply with demands, bad actors simply sell the information on the dark web. With the former, a company reputation can be salvaged, with the latter not so much. Customers want to know that a company will protect their data, not expose their most sensitive information. And who is the most susceptible to a data breach? Small businesses. That\u2019s right. Small businesses are themost at risk of a data breach. The reason? Small businesses are often on a tighter budget and maintain a smaller workforce. Generally, this means that there is less sophisticated technology for data protection and less funding for security teams. A lack of each contributes to weaker overall security controls.Fewer employees maintaining protective systems can make it difficult to recover data or put a stop to a threat actor who gains unauthorized access. How to protect your company from a sensitive data breach \u201c\u2026[I]t is no longer a question of \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201chow often.\u201d I am convinced that there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be.\u201d \u2013Former FBI Director Mueller. So, two questions remain: how do you prevent data breaches? And how do you recover when a data breach happens? How to Prevent a Data Breach 1. Secure data stored using encryption. 2. Ensure endpoint detection and resonse (EDR) systems are in place. 3. Update systems as soon as a patch is released. 4. Employ a dedicated security team that is separate from the IT department. 5. Provide consistent, on-going security training to all employees. 6. Have and practice an incident response plan (IRP). 7. Secure cybersecurity insurance. 8. Conduct regular internal and external penetration tests. 9. Only contract with secure third parties. Network segmentation is simply separating company data from customer data and ensuring both are sufficiently protected. As we realized in real-time with theSEA-TAC airport cyber security attacknot all network systems should be linked. Use full disk encryption and NEVER store any information in the clear. If a bad actor does get in, they will have to spend time unencrypting systems before they get to usable information. Early detection systems, such as Microsoft Defender and other alike tools, alert system administrators when something is happening that shouldn\u2019t be. This early detection system helps companies detect a bad actor in the system and scan for data leaks. Every company \u2013 large and small \u2013 needs not only an EDR but the manpower to investigate the threat. Otherwise a data leak detection system is useless. About15% of data breaches are avoidable. How? Some of the most malicious data breaches in recent years were due to unpatched systems. And worse? Many companies knew about avulnerabilityand didn\u2019t patch the system before it was exploited. Patching your system immediately is one of a handful of simple security measures that protect your company and prevent a data breach. However, it takes time for systems to be patched. An IT team must not only be on the lookout for new patches, but also package and install them in a timely manner. This process can occupy an entire IT team\u2019s time and resources. Instead of packaging and patching manually, considerinstalling a third-party patching softwarethat willautomatically updatesystems when a patch is released. One of the best ways to prevent a data breach is by employing a full-time security team. This team provides much needed security measures such as employee security training, evaluating data security, auditing user accounts, evaluating third party contractors, auditing internal security systems, monitoring for stolen data, monitoring for security threats, and mitigating data breach risks. Additionally, a dedicated security team prevents data breaches by helping companies understand their security posture now and how to improve it for the future. Security teams can put together a data breach report after data breach incidents or data breachattacks. Over70% of all data breaches occur due to human error. Human error is a huge liability when it comes to data breaches. Social engineering attacks are becoming more common especially as AI continues to evolve, with the ability to recreate faces, voices, and other distinguishing characteristics of a person. In fact, some AIcan mimic a face and voice in a real-time video call. Security awareness training for employees should include how to spot phishing scams, managing mobile devices, identity theft protection, having a safe word with loved ones, and the process of reporting phishing attacks. Plus, remember to have set company policies in place to manage employees such as immediately off-boarding disgruntled and terminated employees, re-provisioning employees that change roles, and requiring signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and acceptable use policy(AUP). All the planning in the world will not do you one ounce of good if you don\u2019t have a written and practiced plan of remediation.An IRP, or incident response plan, is a great place to document how your company will respond in case of a breach. Once formalized, use the document to regularly practice a breach scenario making sure the IRP works as intended and adjusting as necessary. Cyber security insurancehelps cover your company after a data security incident. Just like other forms of insurance, it pays those affected so you don\u2019t have to come up with the money on your own. It\u2019s important to be prepared for when, not if, a data breach occurs. Cyber security insurance helps businesses protect themselves financially when a data breach happens. These tests help companies understand the organization\u2019s security posture. Both internal and external penetration tests identify security risks before they are exploited. This is a great way to prevent data leaks by securing intellectual property, adding endpoint security, and securing your internal network. Hiring a full-time auditor to your security team moves this process along. These individuals not only conduct internal penetration tests, but help you obtain industry standard certifications which are often required or preferred by potential customers. The industry certifications close common attack vectors used to breach data. They often require an organization\u2019s network to encrypt data, both private data and critical data, implement multi-factor authentication, mitigate the loss from stolen devices, add endpoint security, and implement access management thus preventing data breaches. An insecure third-party can be an easy way for threat actors to gain unauthorized access and steal data from your organization. When evaluating third parties check their data breach response. If they have compliance documentation, it should cover their security practices, how they shore up common attack vectors, how they respond to data breaches due to human error, and how they protect financial accounts. Ensure you understand what security practices they use to prevent data breaches. Also, understanding what information they collect and where it is stored is another way to prevent data leaks with financial information and access codes. Putting effort into preventing a data breach is important, but equally important is recovering after a data breach. As we know, small businesses are more at risk for a data breach and often don\u2019t have the means to stop data breach attempts or recover quickly. Quickly recovering from a data breach and regaining customer trust is just as important to your bottom line as preventing a breach in the first place. Not all data breaches can be foreseen or mitigated. So, it\u2019s important to know what to do once a data breach occurs. How to Recover After a Data Breach 1. Put your IRP (Incident Response Plan) into action. 2. Mitigate data loss. 3. Understand the scope of the data breach. 4. Make a disclosure. 5. Communicate wisely. When you experience a data breach of any kind the first thing to do is put your IRP into action. If you practice your incident response plan regularly things should move easier and more efficiently. Additionally, documenting all actions taken is extremely worthwhile. This information helps companies not only plan future responses, but may help companies with their legal counsel if government agencies decide to get involved. Making sure as little data is lost as possible is of the utmost importance. Your company may decide to take any of the following actions to prevent data leaks: shut systems down, run backup systems, isolate existing systems, and negotiate with threat actors. While obviously not ideal, cooperating with threat actors may prove the best course of action, especially in a ransomware attack. Although not always possible, ransomware attackers are just in it for the money so giving them what they want is the best way to end a data breach and protect data. Typically, once payment is received, systems are unencrypted. However, it\u2019s important to realize that not all data breaches are ransomware attacks. Other attacks include nation-state, hacktivists, and internal hackers. With these types of attacks, threat actors may be out for ruining a reputation or revenge so the terms of negotiating, if even possible, vary. In fact, somenation-state data breachesare full on military operations with their own budgets. Having a good understanding of exactly what data is breached is extremely important. Noting what data has been exfiltrated or encrypted is important to dealing with data breaches. If the data breached is non-sensitive customer or company data, then a company\u2019s internet security team can work to harden its systems. However, if data leak detection comes to the conclusion that company secrets or personally identifiable information is breached, a company needs to respond to the security risks differently. For example, if data breaches include customer sensitive data such as full name, address, credit report, card numbers, and/or social security number customers need to benotified to take action. This includes setting up multi-factor authentication on accounts, canceling credit cards, obtaining credit reports, monitoring their credit, and locking their credit because this data can lead to unauthorized access to accounts and identity theft. If data includes only company data, then the response needs to focus on internal controls. The global average cost of data breaches in2024 topped $4.88 Million USD. In some countries, companies are expected to disclose data breaches by a certain date. If a business fails to make a disclosure, it can be on the hook not only with indignant customers but with the government as well. For example, the GDPR protects the privacy of consumers in many European countries and stipulates thatcompanies disclose a data breachnot only to customers but to the governing authority as well. In the USlaws vary state to state, so stay up-to-date on what is expected where you operate. It\u2019s important to fully understand what the laws are in the countries in which your company operates. Even if your company doesn\u2019t operate in a country where disclosures are mandatory, manysecurity certificationsrequire disclosure. Therefore, it\u2019s wise to record exactly what occurred from the attack vectors such as whether the attacks were phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, or something else altogether to mitigation actions you took. These can include setting up multi-factor authentication or securing mobile devices. Depending on the company\u2019s size and scope of business, communicating with the public and media outlets may be necessary. The most important thing to communicate is honesty. State concisely what occurred and when, express confidence about mitigation, and protection moving forward. Many data breaches happen to companies each week, so it\u2019s important to help affected customers, if any, and move forward with a strengthened security posture. Data breach prevention simplified In the end, no one can prevent a data breach, but there are things companies can do to mitigate the effects and prepare for the future. Properpatch management softwarecan mitigate these risks using automation \u2014saving time, energy, and streamline processes.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-identifying-security-policies-esp/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How the Enrollment Status Page Tracks Security Policies During Autopilot Ever wondered how theEnrollment Status Page (ESP)identifies which security policies are tracked and applied during Windows Autopilot enrollment? This blog uncovers how it tracks them through the ExpectedPolicies file, and how we can add some (security) policies ourselves! The ESP and the Identifying Security Policies step It all started during one of our MMSMOA sessions. Michael Niehaus mentioned how Autopilot (enrollment status page) only tracksEntDMIDas security policy \u201cSecurity policies (1 of 1 applied)\u201d during ESP. That one line stuck in my head. Not because EntDMID is exciting. It\u2019s not. But because the idea ofonlytracking one placeholder value felt\u2026 off. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: How does ESP actually know which policies are applied, and is it really just EntDMID behind that whole \u201c1 of 1\u201d or the identifying security policies thing? What followed was a weekend of testing, digging into DLLs, SyncML traces, provisioning internals, and of course, a lot of poking with send-localmdmrequest. Let\u2019s walk through it. Step One: The ProgramData Folder and The ExpectedPolicies Once I got back from MMS, I started poking around. I opened up Procmon, sent a send-localmdmrequest -omauri to try and GET the status of the ExpectedPolicies CSP from theDMClient CSP documentation. While using the LOCALMDM request to poke at the DMClient CSP, The system was writing a file to: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\DMClient\\<enrollment-guid>\\FirstSync\\ExpectedPolicies That file seemed to list the policies that the ESP was expecting. One line in particular kept showing up: ./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/EntDMID And it wasn\u2019t just showing up in that file. I also saw it mirrored in the registry under: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Autopilot\\EnrollmentStatusTracking\\ESPTrackingInfo\\Diagnostics\\ExpectedPolicies At that point, I had a new question:Why does ESP only seem to care about EntDMID? Quick side note: What is EntDMID? EntDMID stands forEnterprise Device Management ID. It\u2019s a unique ID created during MDM enrollment that links the device to the management server. But it\u2019s not really a policy. ESP just treats it like one. If EntDMID shows up in the ExpectedPolicies file, it becomes trackable even though it doesn\u2019t configure anything by itself. Back to the story. My assumption was: if EntDMID is the only trackable thing, maybe adding other CSP paths manually to that file would make ESP show more than just \u201cSecurity policies 1 of 1.\u201d That assumption was about to get tested. Hard. Step Two: The Custom CSP to track Security Policies Let me try this the clean way first, I thought. I created a custom configuration profile in Intune with this OMA-URI: ./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/FirstSyncStatus/ExpectedPolicies And gave it this value: ./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/EntDMID./Device/Vendor/MSFT/LAPS/Policies/AutomaticAccountManagementEnableAccount (Side note: yes, I used the correct 0xF000 delimiter between them.) But\u2026 Intune wasn\u2019t impressed. I got 2016281112 (SyncML error code 405). Which makes sense once you re-read the DMClient CSP docs, this node isn\u2019t writable via normal policy. Still, I wasn\u2019t giving up that easily. Step Three: Going Local Time for send-localmdmrequest. I switched to using a local SyncML injection with this PowerShell-based approach: This time, the request succeeded, and I could see the ExpectedPolicies file in ProgramData had been updated. However, after a while, ESP still showed that 1 of the 1 policies had been applied. My extra policy didn\u2019t seem to count, and I quickly realized why. Step Four: Timing is Everything When I first entered the send-localmdm command, the device was still syncing with Intune, and with it, the expected policies got overwritten. However, entering the command too late would also be blocked. Let me explain why! Once provisioning completes, a certain registry key in thefirstsyncnode flips: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments\\<guid>\\FirstSync\\IsServerProvisioningDone Once this value is set to 1, the system stops accepting changes to the ExpectedPolicies node. Even if you send SyncML again or change the file directly, it no longer matters. To fix this, I wrote a script, I waited untilIntune Management Extension (IME)was getting installed. The moment I noticed the Intune Management extension folder appearing I executed the PowerShell script. Sends the local MDM request to inject the ExpectedPolicies entry Then itsets the value IsServerProvisioningDone manually Please NOTE: I used this PowerShell script on the device itself because the moment the Intune Management Extension is installed, it directly moves over to the security policies. The PowerShell scripts themselves don\u2019t have enough time to be executed before the ESP moves over to the security policies. With the local PowerShell script timed correctly, it finally worked! TheESP showed2 of 2 applied. One of them was the ENTMID, and the other one was theLAPS automatic account management. Step Five: Adding More Security Policies to be tracked With the timing right, I could now test real-world policy tracking. Then I added an AppLocker policy to theexpectedpolicieswith: ./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/ApplicationLaunchRestrictions/EXEGroup/EXE/Policy ESP bumped up to3 of 3 applied. To confirm it was really tracking deployment, I removed the AppLocker assignment from Intune. Boom. ESP dropped back to2 of 3 applied, The corresponding ESPtrackinginfo Diagnostics key showed a value of 0 for the AppLocker node. That confirmed it. ESP doesn\u2019t just blindly show the status, it really checks if those ExpectedPolicies are actually applied. But what now? As I really wanted to deploy this idea from Intune using a PowerShell script\u2026 but with a PowerShell script and the CSP not working\u2026 why not converting the PowerShell script to an MSI file? The LOB app will be deployed at the same time as the Intune Management Extension. Convert PowerShell to A LOB App? I wondered if I could somehow convert the PowerShell to an MSI file and deploy it as an LOB app during Autopilot. Well, the idea was pretty good (at first) because the timing is crucial. The expected policies of CSP need to be implemented the moment the IME gets installed, and just before the device switches over to identify security policies. I already knew that using a PowerShell script wasn\u2019t going to do what I wanted as it would kick in too late, but an MSI? Well, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t try. With the use ofIexpress,I converted thePowerShell scriptto an EXE file, and that exe file to a MSI file. And from there on, the PowerShell scripts started another PowerShell script with the -mta and the -encodedcommand parameters. The idea was good, but it was again a matter of timing. Because I needed to install the localmdm module and the NuGet provider first, it just took too long (a couple of seconds) before it could apply the policy. So, I decided to test the same thing, but this time WITHOUT installing the NuGet provider (installing it before enrolling the device) \u2026. well, that did the trick\u2026 it saved me the magical 10 seconds I needed. With the magical 10 seconds less, it indeed kicked in during the Enrollment Status Page Device Setup! Under the Hood: How Security Policy Tracking Really Works By this point, I had also gone peeking inside windows. internal. management. dll and enterprisecsp. dll. The moment the device syncs, the OMADMClient receives the expected policies CSP and executes it. When the CSP gets executed, it will drop the expected policies file in the program data folder. From there, svchost and windows.internal.management.dll pick up the trail. Inside the windows.internal.management, we will spot a function called FirstSync::GetResourceProvisionedCount (part of the main lambda_735d8649ee1050d87d2636f382dd4853 function), the system checks whether a policy listed in the ExpectedPolicies file is actually deployed to the device. If the policy is NOT successfully deployed to your device, the Diagnostics registry key records a 0, and ESP gets stuck on that last line saying \u201cWorking on it\u201d. After the ESP time-out the Security Policies will display (Error) because the policy is NOT deployed! When looking at the shell-core event log, we will notice that the bootstrapstatus will mention that the monitoring policies from management server failed: expected 3 items provisioned, but got only 2. The ESP uses svchost to validate that the policies listed in ExpectedPolicies were actually configured. If one isn\u2019t, ESP keeps waiting. Conclusion: It\u2019s possible to add custom tracking policies At first, I thought EntDMID was just a dummy. And it kind of is. But it\u2019s also a signal. A placeholder that lets ESP know at least one policy is expected, and allows it to start counting. But if you time things right and use the provisioning window carefully, you can make ESP trackmore security policies. As of today, I can add all the policies I want Autopilot/ESP to track\u2026 but still manually. (Even though I proved my point that it is possible) Will Microsoft ever officially support custom ExpectedPolicies tracking? Who knows, but it would be cool if they did! But now we know how it works, and how it breaks.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/how-the-ime-cleans-up-the-imecache-folder/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How the IME Cleans up the IMECache folder This blog explains how the Intune Management Extension (IME) handles the cleanup of the IMECache folder after it has finished installing a Win32App. We will also examine what happens when cleanup fails and why some folders persist even after a reboot. Introduction Let me start by saying that if you\u2019ve ever dug around on a device after a successful Win32 app deployment and found leftover folders inC:\\Windows\\IMECache, you\u2019re not alone. You might have wondered why those folders in the IMECache are still there, even though the win32 app appeared to be successfully installed hours or even days ago. We will walk through how the Intune Management Extension (SideCar) unpacks and manages the Win32 app content. We\u2019ll examine when the folder is reused, when it\u2019s deleted, what triggers re-extraction, and what happens when something blocks the cleanup. From Encrypted download to the IMECache Folder When a Win32 app is deployed through Intune, the .intunewin package first lands in a temporary download location. The moment the file drops down in the incoming folder, it is still encrypted. The agent then decrypts the file and unzips it into a subfolder inside C:\\Windows\\IMECache. (For more details about the whole installation flow, check out ourwebinar) This folder contains the raw content used for detection and installation, think install.cmd, MSI files, PowerShell scripts, or whatever else was packaged. The folder name follows the format of AppId_AppVersion. This unzip and staging process is handled by a component inside the agent called ContentUnzipper. What determines whether IME unzips the Win32App again Here\u2019s where the reuse logic comes in. IME doesn\u2019t automatically unzip the same app every time it\u2019s triggered. It checks whether a matching folder already exists in IMECache. If it does, and the folder is less than 36 hours old, it\u2019s reused. But there\u2019s an override in place. Some flows, like a retry, or certain enforcement cycles, force a re-unzip no matter what. Internally, this is controlled by a parameter called alwaysRefresh. When that\u2019s set to true, IME skips the age check and deletes the folder anyway. So the real behavior looks like this: If the folder is fresh and alwaysRefresh is false, IME reuses it. If it\u2019s older than 36 hours or alwaysRefresh is true, it gets deleted, and the content is unzipped again. After installation, the IMECache cleanup begins.. (or at least tries to) Once the app has been installed successfully, IME attempts to clean up the extracted folder. It does this by calling its internal file system methods to delete the IMECache subfolder. If that delete works, the folder is gone. If it fails due to locked files, bad permissions, or anything else, IME logs the error and schedules the folder for deletion on the next reboot. This is done through the Windows API MoveFileEx. TheMoveFileEXwill add an entry to thePendingFileRenameOperationsregistry value under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager. On the next reboot, Windows checks this registry key and \u201cattempts\u201d to delete whatever was listed. (if it has enough permissions to do so) But that doesn\u2019t always work either. Here\u2019s the thing.MoveFileExworks great for files and folders that are empty and not locked. However, if the folder contains files in use or has restricted permissions, the deletion fails silently. Windows doesn\u2019t log or retry; it just moves on. This is why you may sometimes see lingering folders still sitting in IMECache after a reboot, even though they were clearly marked for deletion in the registry beforehand. What about the IMECache permissions during unzip During the unzip process, IME sometimes sets permissions on the extracted folder, but only under specific conditions. If the app has a contentCacheDuration set to int.MaxValue, which usually means the app should be reused indefinitely across sessions, IME adds Read and Execute permissions for the INTERACTIVE user group. That way, the content can still be accessed. Outside of that case, IME doesn\u2019t mess with permissions. Therefore, if an installer script or MSI changes ACLs during installation, it locks the SYSTEM or administrator account out of the folder, which will block deletion later. It\u2019s worth noting that the IME doesn\u2019t attempt to fix or reset permissions after the app has been installed. So, if you mess with the IMECache folder\u2026 well, good luck\u2026 You need to fix that yourself! The IMECache Leftovers If you\u2019re trying to figure out why a Win32 app keeps reinstalling or why detection fails even though the app is clearly present, the IMECache folder is one of the first places to look. It tells the story of what content was extracted, when, and whether IME thinks it needs to start fresh. It also gives you clues about cleanup failures. If the folder\u2019s timestamp is old or if it persists through reboots, check for leftover locks, permission changes, or detection scripts that still reference it. You can also check the registry under PendingFileRenameOperations to confirm whether IME tried to schedule deletion. Conclusion The IMECache folder is part of a controlled IME/Sidecar process. If an app is installed successfully, the folder should be removed. If that fails, it is scheduled for deletion after a reboot. Also worth noting is that if permissions or locks get in the way, the folder can survive even after multiple reboots. With it you need to manually remove that folder yourself!

The issue caused users to remain in thelocal Administrators groupwhen they should have been demoted to standard users. Introduction InAutopilot Device Preparation,IT admins configure the device preparation policies to define whether the enrolling user should be a local administrator or a standard user. This setting is enforced byStandardUserProvider, a component within the Intune Management Extension (IME) that ensures users are removed from thelocal Administrators groupwhen required. However, as highlighted inthis previous blog,StandardUserProvider frequently failed to execute, leaving users as local administrators when they should have been *demoted. *: The user becomes anAdmin during Entra join(depending on the Entra settings) and would be demoted to a standard user once the IME is installed. The Root Cause: Why Did Standard User Provider Fail? Language-Specific Group Names Caused Lookup FailuresStandardUserProvider originally attempted to find the \u201cAdministrators\u201d group using ahardcoded English name: using (GroupPrincipal byIdentity = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, \u201cAdministrators\u201d)) StandardUserProvider originally attempted to find the \u201cAdministrators\u201d group using ahardcoded English name: using (GroupPrincipal byIdentity = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, \u201cAdministrators\u201d)) On non-English systems, theAdministratorsgroup might be named\u201cAdministratoren\u201d (German), \u201cAdministrateurs\u201d (French), etc. Since \u201cAdministrators\u201d didn\u2019t exist in those languages, the lookupfailed, preventing the user from being removed. No Fallback or Error LoggingIf the lookup failed,StandardUserProvider didn\u2019t attempt a secondary method.There wereno logs explaining why the removal process was skipped.As a result,users retained administrator privileges, even when the provisioning profile required standard user status. If the lookup failed,StandardUserProvider didn\u2019t attempt a secondary method. There wereno logs explaining why the removal process was skipped. As a result,users retained administrator privileges, even when the provisioning profile required standard user status. The Fix: Switching to a SID-Based Approach With the latest IME update,Microsoft replaced name-based lookups with a SID-based method, ensuring Standard User Provider functions reliably across all languages. How IME Fixed Standard User Provider 1. Using a SID-Based Lookup (Language-Independent) Instead of searching by name, IME now finds theAdministrators groupusing itswell-known SID: (which makes 100% sense!) S-1-5-32-544is theuniversal SID for the Administrators group, consistent across all languages. This ensures that Standard User Provideralwaysfinds the correct group, regardless of the system\u2019s language settings. 2. Extracting the User SID from ExecutionContext JSON Previously, StandardUserProviderassumedthe correct user SID was passed but didn\u2019t verify it. The fix now ensures it dynamically retrieves theuser SIDfromExecutionContext JSON: When we open the execution context ourselves, we can spot the same thing. If theuser SID is missing, the processnow logs an explicit reasoninstead of failing silently. 3. Enhanced Logging and Telemetry IME now logsevery action inthe bootstrapper event log, providing better visibility into execution flow and failures: If the group lookup fails, logs nowcapture the exact reasoninstead of skipping execution. New Execution Flow in Standard User Provider With the updated IME logic, StandardUserProvider now follows this structured execution flow in which theremoveuserfromadmingroupmethod is added and plays an important role: Remove User From Admin Group Method As we noticed in the flow above, the real power to remove the user from the admin group lies in this newly added method! 1. The Fix in RemoveUserFromAdminGroup The core logic for removing the user from the Administrators group now follows aSID-basedmethod, ensuringlanguage independenceandconsistent execution. With this new approach, the user is removed from the local administrators group! 2. IME Version with the Fix This fix is included inIME version: Fixed:1.87.101.0 Old (Broken):1.86.101.0 Conclusion With this IME update,Autopilot Device Preparation now properly enforces Standard User configurations, ensuring users are reliably removed from the local Administrators group,regardless of system language. By shifting from aname-based lookupto aSID-based approach, Microsoft now fixed the local administrator bug, ensuring StandardUserProvider functions reliably across different languages and locales.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-vtpm-and-mdm-enrollment-version-6-0-what-you-need-to-know/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune, vTPM, and MDM Enrollment Version 6.0: What You Need to Know! This blog will cover the latest features in MDM Enrollment Version 6.0 and explain their significance for device attestation, virtual TPMs, and Intune. We\u2019ll break down how this enrollment version update changes policy responses, what it means for Azure Attestation, and where support for Cloud PCs and vTPM scenarios seems to be headed. Introduction If you\u2019ve tried running Windows Autopilot on a virtual machine or attempted to use device enrollment attestation with Microsoft Cloud PCs, you\u2019re familiar with the issue. TPM attestation is required, but neither virtual TPMs nor Cloud PCs support it. Enrollment fails before you even get started, and for a long time, there was no way around it. If you want more background on why device attestation matters, take alook at my other article: MDM Enrollment Version 6 appears to be Microsoft\u2019s first step toward addressing this gap. Although there is no official announcement, the protocol changes, new attestation nodes, and WIL features, such as VTpmAttestation, all suggest that the groundwork is being laid for future vTPM and Azure attestation support. But is it actually ready, and what can we prove today? What is Enrollment Version? When a Windows device enrolls in Intune, it doesn\u2019t just send credentials and get a management profile. There\u2019s a protocol handshake (Discovery), and a key part of that is theEnrollment Version. This number defines which features and policy schemas are supported during enrollment and management. Note:[MS-MDE2] (Mobile Device Enrollment Protocol Version 2) is the official Microsoft protocol specification that governs this process.The \u201cEnrollmentVersion\u201d is a value exchanged between the device and the server during protocol negotiation. It determines which features and attestation capabilities are enabled for that enrollment session. Enrollment Version 5.0is what almost every Windows environment has used since Windows 10 first launched. It sets the classic baseline for device management, policy delivery, and certificate handling. Enrollment Version 6.0is a newer protocol version that introduces expanded policy support, especially for attestation scenarios and Azure integration. The Enrollment Version is not just a number. It informs both the device and the MDM server of the expected level of capability. Higher versions enable new policy nodes, new security flows, and (eventually?) support for features such as virtual TPM attestation and Azure-backed trust. Why This Even Matters Classic MDM enrollment treats attestation as a hard requirement in certain scenarios. That works on real hardware, but virtual TPMs in VMs or Cloud PCs just cannot meet the strict attestation requirements. Enrollment Version 6 brings the first technical steps toward solving this, at least on paper. Introducing EnrollmentVersion 6.0 Looking at recent builds and the dmenrollengine.dll, something stands out. In some cases, the device now requests Enrollment Version 6.0, but it doesn\u2019t always receive it, only if the enrollment server (Intune) supports that version (GetServerHighestSupportedVersion). If the server doesn\u2019t support 6.0, the discovery response falls back to Enrollment Version 5.0. So why would a device request version 6.0? The answer lies in new features that have started to surface, most notably VTpmAttestation. (which is a name that makes me wonder what is coming) The CreateDiscoveryMessage function checks the request version and looks for certain flags. If VTpmAttestation is detected, the device switches to request Version 6.0. This signals that the device wants to perform TPM attestation using the new policy logic. In plain terms, if the vTPM attestation feature is enabled, the device will try to use Enrollment Version 6.0. What Enrollment Version 6 Changes: The Real Detail So, what exactly changes withEnrollmentVersion 6.0? The most significant update comes in howTPM azure attestationis handled. A new attestation node appears in the policy schema. Instead of just having fields under privateKeyAttributes, there\u2019s now an attestation node, with its own attributes: attestationFailureBehavior: Decides if enrollment fails, retries, or continues if attestation fails. operationTimeout: Controls how long the device keeps trying attestation before giving up. azureAttestation: Contains fields for a nonce, relying party ID, and endpoint URI, all needed for a cloud-based attestation flow. These attestation nodes are only present if Enrollment Version 6 is used and supported by the server.If not, you\u2019re stuck with the old structure. If both classic and attestation nodes are present, the new attestation nodes take precedence.For example, if both privateKeyAttributes/OperationTimeout and attestation/operationTimeout are sent, the client uses the attestation version. New Attestation Policies:With Version 6.0, the GetPoliciesResponse message can return new policies like attestationFailureBehavior and operationTimeout\u2014critical for controlling what happens if attestation fails. These aren\u2019t present in the 5.0 response. Is This Real Attestation or Just Ignore and Continue? Right now, here\u2019s what really happens. If attestationFailureBehavior is set to IgnoreOnError, the client skips over any attestation errors and keeps enrolling. There\u2019s no actual attestation occurring for vTPMs in this case; it\u2019s merely a policy workaround. The logic is clear: FailonError vs. IgnoreonError:A critical new addition is howattestation failuresare handled. Depending on the policies sent by the server, the client can eitherfailthe enrollment process if attestation fails (FailonError), or continue with a warning (IgnoreonError). This flexibility was missing inVersion 5.0. After spotting this code, the core purpose of this new \u201cEnrollment Version 6.0\u201d becomes clearer. Enrollment Version 6 focuses on Azure Attestation, where the client utilizes the nonce, relying party, and endpoint specified in the policy to communicate with Microsoft\u2019s Attestation service and obtain a trusted response. Enrollment Version 6 is the only way for this new flow to be negotiated, but this attestation behavior flow is not yet enabled in production. Connecting the Dots: Azure Attestation These new attestation nodes are not just protocol details; they are direct hooks into the Microsoft Azure Attestation platform. As explained inmy call4cloud deep dive, Azure Attestation is Microsoft\u2019s answer for evaluating trust in devices, virtual machines, and cloud PCs. When your policy contains nonce, relyingPartyId, and endpointUri under the attestation node, the client is instructed to communicate directly with Azure Attestation to validate device security. This is the only scalable and secure way to hopefully support vTPM and Cloud PC attestation. Until the server starts sending these values, however, the enrollment client cannot utilize Azure Attestation. Reality Check: What Happens Today Even though Windows now requests Enrollment Version 6 (as you\u2019ll see in anyFiddler trace),the server is not yet sending the new attestation nodes in live policy responses.No attestationFailureBehavior, no operationTimeout for modern attestation, and no Azure Attestation details. The live GetPoliciesResponse still looks like it did under Enrollment Version 5.0. This means that while the groundwork is in place, Microsoft has not yet enabled real Azure-based attestation and vTPM support in production. There is no official confirmation or public roadmap, only protocol changes, feature flags like VTpmAttestation, and hints in the documentation. Why This Is About VTpmAttestation (And Why It Matters) While the real purpose of Enrollment Version 6 is to modernize device attestation using new Azure-backed services, another detail stands out. Alongside these attestation changes, we\u2019ve started to see the VTpmAttestation feature appear in code and policy discussions. This is not official documentation about this feature. Still, it clearly signals that Microsoft is laying the groundwork for vTPM and Cloud PC scenarios as part of its future attestation plans. The protocol and policy schema now support these flows, and client-side logic is already present. The server-side is not yet active, and there has been no public statement from Microsoft. However, all technical evidence points in this direction. As soon as Microsoft enables the new attestation nodes and activates Azure Attestation for device enrollment, support for secure vTPM and Cloud PC onboarding may become possible??? What\u2019s Next As soon as these new policy nodes and Azure Attestation fields show up in real tenants, I will post a detailed breakdown of the flow, the logic, and what it means for Autopilot, Cloud PCs, and modern Windows enrollment. If you want to understand what VTpmAttestation is really about, and why it matters for the next phase of device management, watch out for the next blog!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remove-default-microsoft-store-apps-just-prevents-provisioning/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Remove Default Microsoft Store Apps: Prevents Provisioning for New Users Only This blog will be about what actually happens when you enable the new \u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages\u201d from the System policy designed toprevent Store app provisioningin Windows 11 25H2. Spoiler:the Store apps are not removed. They are just blocked from being provisioned for new users Introduction In the previous blog, we looked at the new\u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages from the System\u201dsetting in Windows 11 25H2. Finally, no more inbox apps automatically appearing during provisioning. No more last-minutePowerShell hacksto debloat the system before the user logs in. But once we dug deeper into what\u2019s actually going on (and tried replicating it ourselves), one thing became clear: It Doesn\u2019t Remove Anything Don\u2019t let the name fool you. This setting does not remove Store apps from the system. It does not uninstall anything, does not clean up disk space, and definitely does not affect the existing user profiles. What it actually does is much simpler: It prevents Windows from provisioning those inbox apps fornew users. That\u2019s it! How the Prevent Store App Provisioning Works. After being poked by Vincent on LinkedIn (asking what really happens), we became intrigued and took another deep dive intoAppxAllUserStore.dll,the component behind the provisioning logic. To do so, we used the IDA tool. If you want to learn more about this,check out our YouTube deep dive Using the IDA tool as we showed in the YouTube video above, we spotted the function: AppxAllUserStore::CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore This function clearly moves package files out of the normal provisioning path. Specifically: App package folders in: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps are moved to: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\DeletedAllUserPackages When looking at the device itself, it indeed showed us the same flow. After the user signed in, all the app store packages were moved to the DeletedAllUserPackages: From there on, the flow also deleted (moved) the corrosponding registry entries in: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications are moved to: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Deleted\\Applications That\u2019s it. No uninstall logic. No real user cleanup. Just preventing the provisioning of the Microsoft Store Apps. We Replicated It Ourselves Just to be sure, we wrote a PowerShell script to do exactly what the function does: Move every folder inside C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder (except the Deleted folder itself) Move each corresponding registry key into a new Deleted subkey It worked. No more provisioning of the Microsoft Store Apps. New users logging in didn\u2019t get the apps. And no errors either. It matched Microsoft\u2019s behavior one-to-one. Existing Users? Good Luck Here\u2019s the catch. If the Microsoft Store app was already provisioned for a user before applying the policy (or our manual script), it still works. That\u2019s because user-scoped apps live in: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages These store apps aren\u2019t touched. So, unless you also clean up the per-user profile data or use AppLocker/WDAC(App Control for Business) to block execution,the app is still fully functional. Why This Matters Because Microsoft called it\u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages from the System.\u201d But let\u2019s be clear: it doesn\u2019t seem to remove anything from the system. It justhides the files and registry keys from the provisioning pathso new users don\u2019t see them. With it, the Store Apps will not be provisioned for new users. Visual Mockup We created a mockup to illustrate this point: the Group Policy screen with the word \u201cRemove\u201d crossed out and replaced with\u201cPrevent from being provisioned.\u201d Because that\u2019s actually happening here. Final Thoughts Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I love this new feature, as it\u2019s quite useful. It\u2019s clean. And it\u2019s way better than racing Intune provisioning with brittlePowerShell scripts to debloat the device. But still necessary for existing users!Read our older blog on how to do so. But it\u2019s not a removal mechanism. It\u2019s aprovisioning blocker. And we only figured this out after: Reverse engineering AppxAllUserStore.dll Reading through the CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore function Testing it ourselves with a manual folder and registry move Watching it behaveexactlylike the policy So, if you\u2019re expecting this to fully strip all Microsoft Store apps from the device, including those used by existing users, you\u2019ll be a bit disappointed. It doesn\u2019t clean. It hides. And that makes all the difference.

We decided to dig into it. What we found was a breakdown in the SLDM Provider phase and a strong connection to how many Win32 apps were assigned as required. In this blog, we\u2019ll walk through why SLDM never completes, how that blocks the rest of the provisioning process, and how assigning too many win32 apps as required (even if they\u2019re NOT marked as required in the AP-DP profile!!!) might be the root cause.

The device moves through the initial steps. But after installing the management extension, it gets stuck on\u201cInstalling required apps and scripts for your organization\u201d It sits there for 20, 30, maybe 40 minutes, depending on how long you configured the setting: \u201cMinutes allowed before showing installation error\u201d in theAutopilot Device Preparation profile, until it finally gives up and throws the error:We can\u2019t complete device setup. The first thing we did was check out the newAP-DP Monitor functionality With the Autopilot Device Preparation monitor showing us nothing really useful (except the policy installation that failed), we took a closer look at the Intune Management Extension AppWorkload log to determine which app was the culprit; however, the IME AppWorkload log was quite empty. No mention of Win32 apps, no scripts, no trace of anything getting installed. One thing was for sure It wasn\u2019t the Managed Installer issue (we covered thathere). This time, the issue seemed to have occurred earlier in the Device Preparation chain, to be precise, during theSLDM phase. However, before we zoom in on what went wrong, it\u2019s helpful to understand how Autopilot Device Preparation is structured behind the scenes. It doesn\u2019t just fire off scripts and app installs randomly; everything happens in a strict sequence of four internal phases. The Four Phases of Autopilot Device Preparation So let\u2019s discuss the four phases of AP-DP first, then. As mentioned above,Autopilot Device Preparation(AP-DP) follows a strict execution order made up of four internal providers: StandardUserProvider\u2013 Removes the Entra user from the local Administrators group, updates ESP status text, and sets registry markers. SldmProvider\u2013 Requests required apps, monitors the provisioning state, checks for reboot needs, and signals MDM setup completion. PowerShellScriptProvider\u2013 Runs device-assigned PowerShell scripts. Win32AppProvider\u2013 Installs Win32 apps assigned to the device. Each batch phase only runs if the one before it completes successfully. In this case, the SLDM phase didn\u2019t finish successfully, and after the time-out, it was cancelled. With the SLDM provider batch being canceled, Win32 apps and PowerShell scripts never even begin. Let me start explaining each batch a bit more. The StandardUserProvider Before anything else happens in the Autopilot Device Preparation batch flow, the StandardUserProvider is called. Its job is to configure the account type by removing the Entra user from the local Administrators group, depending on the Autopilot-DP profile. Once it is done, it will update the ESP status message to \u201cInstalling required apps and scripts for [company name]\u201d, set key registry flags, and signal readiness for SLDM to start. If thisStandardUserproviderdoesn\u2019t complete successfully, none of the others will run. (which we noticed in this blog as well) In our case,StandardUserProviderbatch finished fine. The local administrator group was updated. The Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment proceeded, and the following item in the batch order was theSLDM Provider. The Autopilot Device Preparation SLDM Provider Next comes theSldmProvider,short forStateless Device Management.Its role is to initiate the provisioning process by requesting the list of required apps, monitoring the installation state reported by the MDM agent, and sending progress signals back to the service. It acts as the key orchestrator for MDM provisioning during Autopilot Device Preparation. If you want to take a small peak yourself at how this looks like in the IME code, you will need to use the dotPeek Tool as I am explaining in this YouTube video. Here\u2019s how the SLDM process works in practice: SLDM Under the Hood \u2013 Visual Walkthrough To make things more concrete for people who don\u2019t like mermaid flow, here\u2019s what the SLDM process looks like when you trace it from the network and CSP activity: Let me walk you through each step so it becomes clear what broke down The device sends a POST request to r.manage.microsoft.com with the DevicePrep payload including theExecutingProvisioning alert. This initiates the Device Preparation phase in the cloud service. The service responds by delivering a SyncML payload with the CSP node:./Device/Vendor/MSFT/DevicePreparation/MDMProvider/Progress. This CSP above contains theserialized progress blob, listing each workload (workloadId) and its current state (DeploymentWorkloadState), starting withworkloadState:1(InProgress). The SLDM provider running in the Intune Management Extension reads theProgressblob, deserializing it into in-memoryDeploymentWorkloadDtoobjects. It tracks fields such as: workloadId workloadState friendlyName and additional metadata like timestamps or error codes. This data becomes the working set that SLDM uses to determine the provisioning progress When we examine the progress blob sent over in step 2 more closely, we will notice that theWorkloadState:1 indicates the SDLM is in progress. If theIntune back-endsuccessfully evaluates app assignments and policies, and determines that a workload has completed, itre-sends the same Progress CSPwith an updated state: This means the workload isCompleted, and the SLDM provider will interpret it asProvisioningComplete. As shown below, we could also get some other results. Once all workloads have reached aProviderResultofProvisioningComplete(as mapped fromworkloadState), the SLDM provider sends a finalPOSTtor.manage.microsoft.com, signaling that provisioning has finished successfully. Failure Case: Progress CSP Never Updates to Completed If the updatedProgressBlobnever arrives,meaning no workloads transition toworkloadState:2, the SLDM provider keeps polling, waiting for completion.Since that state changenever happens, the finalProvisioningComplete signal is never sent back to the service, and Autopilot Device Preparation justhangs until timeout(depending on your settings), returning: This issue wasonly observed with Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP), not classic Autopilot (APv1). That led to the suspicion thatEnrollmentTimeGroup (ETG), introduced alongside AP-DP, plays a role. ETG may delay or suppress the policy grouping logic needed to generate the correct Progress CSP with workload completions. Enrollment Time Grouping and Autopilot Device Preparation Enrollment Time Groupingwas designed to reduce redundant processing. Instead of evaluating each app and assignment individually per device, the backend groups devices together at enrollment time and evaluates shared assignments once. The goal is to optimize app targeting logic and reduce strain on the backend. The moment the device is enrolled (Entra join), it will be automatically added to this enrollment time group in the background. All apps that are assigned to this enrollment time group will be processed during the AP-DP Enrollment. However, we noticed that the Win32 apps weren\u2019t really targeted at this group, but at \u2018All Devices\u2019 instead. That made us realize something else must be going wrong. The Win32 App Limit and Autopilot Device Preparation That\u2019s when we began investigatinghow manyapps could actually be assigned as required without breaking AP-DP. When too many Win32 apps are marked as*required for all devices, the entire AP-DP provisioning cycle stalls. We tested this in our lab by gradually assigning large numbers of apps. *Updates are marked as required for all devices to ensure that if the App exists on any device, it will be updated automatically. At first, everything worked fine. But as the number increased, Autopilot Device Preparation began to fail consistently. The backend logic stopped scaling. TheProgress CSPwithworkloadState: 2never arrived on the device. Without it, the SLDM provider timed out and returned: After spending a lot of time in our LABS, we found the limit!!!!! The exact number of maximum assigned apps was256.Sounds like a human set limit. 256. It also sounds like a coincidence, given that I published the upcoming fix for theBitLocker 256-bit issue during AP-DP:)\u2026 Once you hit257, AP-DP provisioning fails. The device never receives the updated progress state (workloadstate:2), and the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment will fail! But We Didn\u2019t Assign 257 Apps to AP-DP\u2026 Did We? Let\u2019s be clear\u2026we didn\u2019t assign 257 apps to the Autopilot Device Preparation profile. (which is not even possible\u2026 ) In fact, we only scopeda single Win32 app, a single Store App and the MS365 apps in that AP-DP profile. Only those three apps should\u2019ve been evaluated and installed during provisioning. The rest were just marked asrequired for all devicesin the assignments, but they weren\u2019t included in the actual AP-DP config. So the bottom line\u2026they shouldn\u2019t have been involved at all! But clearly, the backend didn\u2019t care. It evaluatedeverything, regardless of what the ap-dp profile told it to focus on. That\u2019s why this issue was so confusing at first. It looked like a single app failing but behind the scenes, the whole provisioning logic was choking on the full set of required apps (which exceeded the 256 apps). What You Can Do About It A practical workaround until Microsoft is going to fix it, could be: Defer non-critical apps until after the AP-DP enrollment. That way, SLDM has a better chance of completing and handing off control to the next stage. We can do so by ensuring that all Win32 App updates are configured to be excluded for the Enrollment Time Group. With it, the Win32 App Updates are not configured as required for devices that are enrolling. From then on, we can remove the device from that group the next day with theAzure Runbook. Once the device is no longer a member of that group, the Updates for the Win32 Apps are no longer excluded and will be installed on all devices that have the app installed once it checks in. Microsoft their Response It\u2019s pretty obvious we contacted Microsoft about this issue. So far, there\u2019s no public documentation or fix available, but if we\u2019re able to share more in the future, we\u2019ll update this blog. Conclusion While Microsoft hasn\u2019t published an official limit, internal observations suggest that provisioning logic during Autopilot Device Preparation might not handle high volumes of Win32 app assignments gracefully, particularly when app status reporting is involved. At >256 app assignments, things stop scaling predictably.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-update-client-policies-error-2016281112/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Policies showing error code -2016281112 This blog covers a weird issue where Windows Update client policies deployed through Intune began to fail after devices were upgraded to Windows 11 24H2. As soon as the upgrade finished and the Windows Update Client policy was applied, you might see error code65000, 2016281112, or 201628111showing up in Intune. Introduction You might already be familiar with error code 65000 from another blog we wrote about ADMX ingestion being broken. If not, you can read more about that scenario here:Intune Settings Catalog Error Code 65000.That blog shows you what happens under the hood of the ADMX ingestion and is pretty important to know when troubleshooting Policy issues. In this blog, I\u2019ll focus on a different reason why2016281112 (Recovery Failed) and 201628111(Not Applicable) appear in Intune, specifically when deploying Windows Update client policies on devices that have recently been upgraded to Windows 11 24H2. Even though the built-in WindowsUpdate.admx file was present, the update policy still failed with error2016281112 or 201628111.Let\u2019s take a closer look at why that happens and how to fix it. Windows Update Client Policies: Error 2016281112 Let\u2019s say, you\u2019ve configured some Windows Update Client policies through Intune by configuring the Update Rings. Everything looked fine\u2026until some devices, the ones recently upgraded to Windows 11 24H2, started failing. Policy deployment status: failed. Error: 2016281112/201628111. The Windows Update Client policy won\u2019t apply, and Intune shows the 2016281111 / -2016281112 status error. Looking at the error details, you\u2019ll see something like: The Windows Update Client policy itself is valid. It worked before, and it still works on freshly installed machines. However, it appears that on some devices, the Windows 11 feature update may silently fail. Let\u2019s dig in on why that happened and why those Windows Update Client policies are failing. Looking at the Device: Missing Default Update Policies Once we were able to log in to such a problematic device, things became even more confusing. I was expecting the WindowsUpdate.admx to be missing in action\u2026 which would have made a lot of sense, when looking back at the \u201cthe system cannot find the file specified\u201d error. However, the WindowsUpdate.admx file was present inC:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions. However, when you check the registry under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\default\\Update, you will notice that most of the usual subkeys are missing. As shown above, there\u2019s no DeferQualityUpdatesPeriodIn Days. No ConfigureDeadlineForFeatureUpdates.This is why Intune reports error-2016281112, and why the policy ends in failure code 65000, the CSP URI doesn\u2019t exist because the backing registry structure wasn\u2019t created. Background: What Should Have Happened When a Windows device is freshly installed, even without any internet connection, the OS automatically creates a base set of policy registry keys under:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\default This includes default nodes like Update, WiFi, and SmartScreen. These keys are created as part of OS setup, long before Intune or any MDM enrollment ever occurs. The DLL responsible for this is PolicyManager.dll, and it builds out the initial policy structure based on built-in ADMX templates like WindowsUpdate.admx. On a clean install, this always works (well, it should). But it seems after a feature update from, such as updating from Windows 11 22H2 to 24H2, this initialization sometimes fails silently. The OS upgrade process skips or breaks the step where it needs to recreate the policy provider structure. Even though the Windows Update ADMX file is present, the CSP paths it defines cannot be used because there is no registry mapping in the policymanager\\default. When Intune pushes a policy tied to one of those missing CSPs, it fails with:Error code: -2016281112 (SyncML error 404) / Intune status: 65000 And because this failure occurs within the OS, no logs or Event Viewer entries ever mention the actual root cause. Fixing the Windows Update Client Policy error: 2016281112 1. Validate the ADMX file First, check thatWindowsUpdate.admxis present in:C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions Open the ADMX file and check if it contains all the settings that are causing the error. Ensure the ADMX is up to date and valid. If theWindowsUpdate.admxitself is missing, you have a different problem. If it\u2019s there, the issue lies in the policy platform, not the ADMX file itself. 2. Check if the CSP-backed registry keys exist Open regedit and open this registry key: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\default\\Update Look for values like DeferQualityUpdatesPeriodInDays. If these are missing, you\u2019ve found your problem. The Update Policy root was never initialized, and Intune\u2019s Update Ring or Settings Catalog policy fails with error code 65000 or -2016281112 because it can\u2019t bind to that nonexistent path. 3. Option A: Copy from a working device Export the fullPolicyManager\\default\\Updateregistry node from a clean working 24H2 system. Import it into the broken device using:reg import UpdateFix.reg This restores the missing structure, allowing the CSP to function as expected. Simple fix, right? Of course, you can also script this. To script this, you need to export the existing update registry node from a working device to base64. Once you have the base64 export, you can push a PowerShell script to import it on those breaking devices. 4. Option B: Rebuild using a PowerShell script Use a script that programmatically creates the registry keysdefault\\Updatebased on what should have been created during OS setup. This method avoids needing another machine andrebuilds the entire Update policy nodeby parsingWindowsUpdate.admxdirectly. This script: Identifies the correct WMI class for the Update policy area Recompiles theDMWmiBridgeProv.mofif the class is missing Extracts metadata (like value ranges and group policy blocking paths) from the ADMX file Writes all required fields (mergealgorithm,policytype,GPBlocking*,Behavior, and defaultvalue) into the registry It closely mirrors what the OS should have done during feature setup and ensures thePolicyManager\\default\\Updatestructure matches the real policy contract defined in the system. 5. Option C: Full re-enrollment to fix 2016281112 As a last resort, unenroll the device, clean up the MDM enrollment keys, and re-enroll. This forces the CSPs and policy platform to rebuild fully ,but it\u2019s the most disruptive and slowest option\u2026 and the option we always try to avoid! What You\u2019ll See in Logs or Intune when the Windows Update Client Policies are Failing Intune reports the policy as failed with an error code 2016281111 / 2016281112 SyncML responses show:404 The system cannot find the file specified. Event Viewer gives no usable context On the device, registry values for expected CSPs likeDeferQualityUpdatesPeriodInDaysare simply missing Nothing gets applied Error Code: -2016281112 Wrap-up This is a classic case of a feature update breaking something silently.The policy works. The CSP exists. The ADMX file is present. However, after an upgrade, the system fails to rebuild part of its policy backbone, and Intune is left attempting to check and write to a registry path that doesn\u2019t exist. If you\u2019re rolling out Windows 11 24H2 and start seeing Update Ring errors with code65000or -2016281112, don\u2019t assume the policy is wrong. Check the registry. If the backing structure is gone, you now know how to restore it.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/tpm-attestation-failures-windows-autopilot/", "title": "", "raw_text": "TPM Attestation Failures in Windows Autopilot: The Unexpected Timeout Error (0x800705b4) Recently, we\u2019ve seen Windows Autopilot devices, particularly HP EliteBooks and Lenovo T480s, encountering 0x800705b4 timeout errors during TPM attestation. This crucial step ensures that a device\u2019s TPM is trusted, but something is going wrong in the process, causing these models to fail during deployment. In this post, we\u2019ll explore the typical TPM attestation flow, examine the Windows Autopilot TPM Attestation errors, and investigate why these specific devices are experiencing issues. Calling the Autopilot Attestation Fix-Man! So, there I was, enjoying my coffee when suddenly, a message lit up myDiscord,complete with a \u201cBat-Signal\u201d of sorts (see image for reference ). It was time to step up. As we all know,Patch My PCdoes incredible work for the community, and this time, I\u2019m doing my part by answering the call for help. Devices were failingTPM attestationduring Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployments (White-glove) with the dreaded Windows Autopilot TPM Attestation0x800705b4error! As shown above, during securing your hardware, the 0x800705b4 was thrown at my feet. It was time to dive deep and help fix this issue for everyone. I\u2019ll be teaming up with Microsoft on this one to crack the case and get those attestation failures resolved. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the issue, the attestation flow, and why a recently renewedCA 035 certificatemight be causing more headaches than expected for devices like theHP EliteBook 800andLenovo T480. Let\u2019s dive in and fix this together for the community! Everything Happens for a reason. Interestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve encountered this particular issue. In another case I was working on, someone contacted me about a device that failed during app installations in the Autopilot enrollment process. It turned out there was a cryptographic issue with secure channels. This issue caused the IME to be unable to contact the service. You can read about that situationhere. (which is still a work in progress until MSFT comes up with the fix) Fast forward to the Discord message I received, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice something familiar. The device involved was pretty similar to the one I had been working on in that earlier case. His devices that failed TPM attestation had the same Infineon TPM. It felt like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment, as the root cause behind both issues seemed to share a common thread. That\u2019s when I realized there might be more at play here, and it required a deeper look into what could be causing these devices to behave this way. Let\u2019s start with some background information about TPM attestation issues TPM Attestation issues A day without TPM attestation issues is like a day without having TPM attestation issues. In the past, I have debugged many Attestation issues from every single TPM vendor in the world. One of the best examples ofTPM attestation issues is the AMD one. When you are experiencing the 0x800705b4 timeout error and using the AMD platform. You will also notice some additional errors besides the generic timeout error, theHResult0x80070490and the HResult0x80070491errors When looking at this generic error in the moderndeployment Autopilot log, it will only show you that an Autopilot.dll WIL error was reported file onecoreuap admin moderndeployment autopilot dll dllmain.cpp line 128. Which literally doesn\u2019t tell you anything useful? Shall I zoom into how TPM attestation should work ? How TPM Attestation Should Work When a device is enrolled through Windows Autopilot for provisioned deployments, it undergoes TPM attestation as part of the security validation. The goal is to ensure that the device\u2019s TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is genuine, secure, and able to protect the system\u2019s cryptographic keys. You can kick off this process quite easily by entering certreq -enrollaik -config \u201c\u201d from a cmd Not PowerShell! Otherwise, you would receive the 0x80070057 the parameter is incorrect error) Besides using the certreq tool (like I always do) you can also use the tpmdiagnostics tool. When we execute the command to enroll the Windows AIK Cert, the normal attestation process will involve a couple steps: GetCACaps: The device communicates with the server to determine the Certification Authority\u2019s (CA) supported capabilities, such as algorithms and protocols. GetCACaps: The device communicates with the server to determine the Certification Authority\u2019s (CA) supported capabilities, such as algorithms and protocols. GetCACertChain: The device retrieves the necessary certificates from the CA to validate its trust in the root and intermediate certificates. This is called walking the cert chain GetCACertChain: The device retrieves the necessary certificates from the CA to validate its trust in the root and intermediate certificates. This is called walking the cert chain PKIOperation: The device sends a signed certificate signing request (CSR) using itsTPM\u2019s Endorsement Key (EK). The server verifies the request against the CA chain and responds with a signed certificate, confirming that the TPM attestation was successful. PKIOperation: The device sends a signed certificate signing request (CSR) using itsTPM\u2019s Endorsement Key (EK). The server verifies the request against the CA chain and responds with a signed certificate, confirming that the TPM attestation was successful. So, what\u2019s going wrong? Everything seems to proceed as expected until thePKIOperationstep, where the server refuses to accept the TPM\u2019s identity, resulting in a0x800705b4 timeout error. After tracing the issue, it became clear that something deeper was affecting the process. When looking at the error we got when trying to enroll, things become a bit more strange 0x80190190 (2145844848 HTTP_E_STATUS_BAD_REQUEST) After executing the certenroll command on our own device, this is what it told us First off, it tells us that there is no valid TPM EK/Platform certificate provided in the TPM Identity request message. Which is pretty weird as the device has the EK cert and it was ready for attestation? Besides telling us that it failed to provide the EK/Platform it also shows us the error 0x80190190 which corresponds to Bad request (400). What\u2019s happening here? Confirming the Presence of the EKCert One of the first things we did was check whether the device had theEKCert(Endorsement Key Certificate) installed. Using theTPMDiagnostics tooland theget-tpmendorsementkeyinfo command, we confirmed that theEKCertwas present on the device. This validation was echoed in the event logs as well, showing that theAutopilotManagerhad successfully located theAIK keyand theEK certificate. However, despite the Endorsement Key (EK) certificate being present, the logs also indicated that theAIK key failed the certificate request, returning anHRESULT = 0x80090011error, further pointing to a problem with the attestation process. Things are becoming stranger and stranger. Well this is what I really love\u2026 With the EK Cert on the device, it\u2019s time to walk the chain! Walking The Chain I made sure I got Fiddler in place from system context (otherwise you won\u2019t spot it) With Fiddler enabled I manually tried to enroll the AIK certificate and by the looks of it, the next TPM attestation step breaks after walking the chain. Let me explain a bit about how this chainwalk works from a bigger perspective. Device (Client) The device\u2019s TPM has an Endorsement Key (EK) that is signed by the Infineon OPTIGA(TM) RSA Manufacturing CA 035. The device presents its EK certificate to the attestation server as part of the TPM attestation process. Intermediate Certificate: CA 035 CA 035 is the intermediate certificate issued by Infineon. This certificate acts as a trusted link between the TPM\u2019s EK certificate and the root certificate that the attestation server trusts. Root Certificate: Microsoft TPM Root CA The root certificate is the Microsoft TPM Root Certificate Authority 2014. The root certificate is trusted by the attestation server and validates the CA 035 certificate. The Intermediate Certificate Even with the whole CACertChain response scrambled, you can read through the lines. While doing so, I downloaded each certificate from the response and started looking at it. This certificate url corresponds to the Intermediate one. It seems all valid, right? Upon further investigation, I started having doubts about thisCA 035 certificateissued by Infineon. This certificate wasrenewed just a few months ago, and judging by its smell, it is causing the attestation failures. If you look back at what happens when walking the chain, this CA035 certificate is pretty important in the process. Why? Let me show you once again! As shown above, this ca 035 needs to be validated. What if there was a misalignment in the Microsoft attestation services? Certificate Chain Mismatch After a great conversation with my friends from Microsoft, they identified and resolved the issue. With the issue being resolved I was curious what changed. After executing the same AIK enrollment commands, we will notice that we got a different CA certificate. We now get an older one instead of the one that was valid from 6/6/2024! Now that Microsoft changed the CA certificate, devices using Windows Autopilot for Pre-provisioned deployment and using the Infineon TPM with the CA 035 should no longer face this problem. Problem solved once again! To end the story with a summary: Walking the Chain is one of the most important steps during attention. When the certificate is not trusted everything crumbles and your device will fail to perform attestation!.

In this blog post, we want to cover some changes to the way we setupdate classificationsin our third-party software update catalog and why we decided to make these changes based on our customer\u2019s feedback. Topicscovered in this article: A Little Background on Software Update Classifications from Microsoft How We Classified Updates in the Past and Why Why We are Changing the Classification to Best Match Each Update What do These Changes Mean for You? When Will This Change Happen? A Little Background on Software Update Classifications from Microsoft First, we want to cover whatupdate classificationsare and how we classify updates in our catalog and some of the changes we are making to better align with the Microsoft terminology for classifications. Every software update in WSUS/ConfigMgr will be assigned to a Vendor/Product and have anUpdate Classification. There are currently nine types of classifications for software updates in Configuration Manager. Critical Updates| Definition: A widely released fix for a specific problem that addresses a critical, non-security-related bug. Definition Updates| Definition: A widely released and frequent software update that contains additions to a product\u2019s definition database. Definition databases are often used to detect objects that have specific attributes, such as malicious code, phishing websites, or junk mail. Feature Packs| Definition: New product functionality that is first distributed outside the context of a product release and that is typically included in the next full product release. Security Updates| Definition: A widely released fix for a product-specific, security-related vulnerability. Security vulnerabilities are rated by their severity. The severity rating is indicated in the Microsoft security bulletin as critical, important, moderate, or low. Service Packs| Definition: A tested, cumulative set of all hotfixes, security updates, critical updates, and updates. Additionally, service packs may contain additional fixes for problems that are found internally since the release of the product. Service packs may also contain a limited number of customer-requested design changes or features. Tools| Definition: A utility or feature that helps complete a task or set of tasks. Update Rollups| Definition: A tested, cumulative set of hotfixes, security updates, critical updates, and updates that are packaged together for easy deployment. A rollup generally targets a specific area, such as security, or a component of a product, such as Internet Information Services (IIS). Updates| Definition: A widely released fix for a specific problem. An update addresses a noncritical, non-security-related bug. Upgrades| Definition: A feature upgrade for Windows 10. How We Classified Updates in the Past and Why When theConfiguration Manager synchronizes software updates from WSUS, only software updates assigned to anenabled classificationwillsynchronizeand show up in the configuration manager console. When we initially started to author updates, we decided to classifyall third-party software updateswith theSecurityClassification.The reason we decided to classify all updates with theSecurity classificationis because it s the most common classification that would be enabled forsynchronization in ConfigMgr/WSUS. By setting updates to use the Security Classification, it would ensure any third-party updates are published regardless of whether they areSecurity Updates,Critical Updates,Updates,etc.from our catalog would synchronize and be visible in Configuration Manager. Why We are Changing the Classification to Best Match Each Update We\u2019ve received feedback that by havingall third-party software updatesclassified asSecurity Updatesit can cause the software update compliance reporting to be skewed when filtering on the security classification. Based on customer feedback, we will now be classifying all third-party software updatesbased on the vendors release notesand best align each software update to correspond to the closestupdate classification. We plan to utilize the following update classifications for our third-party software updates. Critical Updates| A widely released fix for a specific problem that addresses a critical, non-security-related bug. Security Updates| A widely released fix for a product-specific, security-related vulnerability. Security vulnerabilities are rated by their severity. The severity rating is indicated in the Microsoft security bulletin as critical, important, moderate, or low. If the vendor indiciates a higher severity, we will use that instead. Updates| A widely released fix for a specific problem. An update addresses a noncritical, non-security-related bug. Update Rollups| TheUpdate RollupsClassificationwill be used for migration updates such asJRE 6/7 to JRE 8 migrationorFirefox to Firefox ESR migration. What do These Changes Mean for You? We believe this change is necessary and will provide a better experience for our customers to ensure the update metadata best aligned with the actual update type. This change will have no impact on the publishing process you are performing today. When publishing third-party updates, you will want to ensure theclassificationsin the software update point that corresponds to the third-party updates are enabled. If the classification isn\u2019t enabled, the third-party software update will not sync into the Configuration Manager console until the classification is enabled in your software update point and another synchronization is performed. When Will This Change Happen? We plan to apply these metadata changes toall updates going forwardas well asretroactively for updates released in the past. Since this is only a metadata change, updates can berepublished/revisedso the new software update classification will be reflected after the software update point synchronization in Configuration Manager. These metadata changes will be released in theOctober 22, 2018 catalog update.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-s-restart-grace-period/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune\u2019s Restart Grace Period Simplified Introduction Have you ever experienced the frustration of your computer demanding an immediate restart right in the middle of an important task? We\u2019ve all been there. In this blog, we will be diving into something that\u2019s a real game-changer when it comes to device management. The Intune Restart Grace Period will help your devices run smoothly and make sure the updates are installed successfully when deployed through Intune. No more jargon or complicated stuff \u2013 we\u2019re breaking it down so you can understand, configure, and make the most of this nifty feature. Let\u2019s roll! Intune Restart Grace Period Think of the Device Restart Grace Period in Microsoft Intune like hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock. Let\u2019s assume that you are using your computer and that it is time toupdatesome critical software. Normally, the default device restart behavior would require you to restart the computer immediately to complete the update process, but sometimes that is not convenient. Maybe you\u2019re in the middle of some important work and a sudden restart would interrupt everything. In this situation, theRestart Grace periodcomes to the rescue. It\u2019s like telling your computer \u201cHey, I\u2019m in the middle of something, can we please delay the restart for a bit\u201d. From Intune, you can specify a time interval during which your computer can continue running without interruption after the update is installed. For example, you can schedule a 1-hour grace period. This means that your computer will keep running smoothly for that hour, allowing you to finish your work. But when that hour is up, your computer will politely remind you to restart so that it can apply the updates and keep your system secure and up to date. Making the Restart Grace Period a thoughtful feature designed to make your life easier. This clever feature allows your device to hit the snooze button on that mandatory restart for a set period of time after those updates have been installed. Configure the Restart Grace Period Let\u2019s configure the restart grace period for an app in your Intune tenant: Log in to the Microsoft Intune Portal and sign in with your admin credentials. Head to an app under Apps > All Apps > Select the app for which you want to set the restart grace period.Scenario: For this blog post I\u2019ve tested this feature with7-zip: it is deployed it as \u201cavailable\u201d with a grace period value of \u201c20 minutes,\u201d the restart countdown set to \u201c10 minutes,\u201d and the snooze value for the restart notification set to \u201c2minutes.\u201d I\u2019ve tested this for \u201cHard reboot\u201d. Manually alter the default return exit codes under the program section of the app package to ensure that a successful install value of \u201c0\u201d ensures a hard reboot. You can change the exit return code based on how you want to use and display it. Assign the app as \u201cAvailable\u201d with the Restart Grace period setting \u201cenabled\u201d. Enable the Restart Grace period and set the values.You can customize the following options:Device restart grace period (minutes): The default value is 1,440 minutes (24 hours). This value can be a maximum of 2 weeks.Select when to display the restart countdown dialog box before the restart occurs (minutes): The default value is 15 minutes.Allow user to snooze the restart notification: You can chooseYesorNo.Select the snooze duration (minutes): The default value is 240 minutes (4 hours). The snooze value can\u2019t be more than the reboot grace period. You can customize the following options:Device restart grace period (minutes): The default value is 1,440 minutes (24 hours). This value can be a maximum of 2 weeks.Select when to display the restart countdown dialog box before the restart occurs (minutes): The default value is 15 minutes.Allow user to snooze the restart notification: You can chooseYesorNo.Select the snooze duration (minutes): The default value is 240 minutes (4 hours).

Select when to display the restart countdown dialog box before the restart occurs (minutes): The default value is 15 minutes. Allow user to snooze the restart notification: You can chooseYesorNo.Select the snooze duration (minutes): The default value is 240 minutes (4 hours). The snooze value can\u2019t be more than the reboot grace period. Select the snooze duration (minutes): The default value is 240 minutes (4 hours). The snooze value can\u2019t be more than the reboot grace period. For the restart behavior, select when to display the restart countdown dialog box before the restart occurs. Click on \u201cOk\u201d and then review and save. Client-Side Behavior Let\u2019s review the behavior on the client side and see how the restart grace period gets triggered. The Intune management extension is responsible for performing all the actions on the client machines. The IME agent is responsible for receiving policy assignments and executing them on the client machine. When the user tries to install the application, and after it is successfully installed, you will get something like this initially. This is a generic toast notification the user will get from Intune. After a minute, the user will get a notification like this in the bottom-right corner: When you head back to the Intune Portal, you will see this: On the client machine: as soon as the user clicks on snooze, after every 2 minutes, they will get a prompt notification on the screen where they can snooze the notification until the restart countdown is reached. Example: If a user triggers an install at 6:10 AM, after a minute, he will get the notification in the bottom right corner. The user clicks on snooze, and now, after every 2 minutes, he will get a message in the middle of the screen, and he can take action and snooze. Suppose the user clicks on snooze again after 2 minutes. In that case, they will get another notification until the restart countdown time is reached, which by default in our case will be 6:20. After 6:20 AM, the user will get a notification with no snooze option. And now, after the grace period is completed, the device will forcefully restart to finalize your update/app installation. Return Codes Return codes are usually associated with actions executed on devices through Intune. These return codes are used to indicate the success or failure of a particular operation. Based on return codes, their meanings can vary depending on the context and action being performed. In the above example, I\u2019ve altered the default return codes to ensure that a successful install value of \u201c0\u201d ensures a hard reboot. Hard Reboot and Soft Reboot Hard reboot: This means a forceful restart will occur, after which the machine will be turned back on. Intune will force a mandatory device restart. It will not let the user postpone or delay beyond a certain point, in this case, after the restart grace period is reached. Soft Reboot: This is more user-centric. In this case, the device will prompt the user to restart after updates have been installed. You will get a generic notification in the bottom-right corner of the screen, under the \u201c Notification\u201d blade. Advantages of Using the Restart Grace Period Fewer Annoying Interruptions:It\u2019s awesome because it lets your computer wait a bit before restarting itself after getting updates. When you\u2019re super busy with important stuff or chatting with friends online your computer won\u2019t suddenly interrupt you. You\u2019re in Charge:Think of it like this: instead of your computer deciding to restart on its own right when you\u2019re busy, this feature lets you choose when it should restart. So, you\u2019re the boss, not your computer! Admins Rejoice:For the tech wizards juggling many devices, this is like a vacation. Updates happen, but the chaos takes a backseat. Offers Customization: Intune provides flexibility in defining the length (in minutes) of the restart grace period, allowing organizations to tailor it to their own requirements. As a result of this customization, the functionality may be tailored to different user groups or use cases. Reporting and Monitoring: Intune provides reports to administrators to track the progress of restarts across their company. You may also find these under the \u201cDevice Install Status\u201d section. The Catch: What to Watch Out For Balance Act: Picking the right time before your device restarts is like finding the sweet spot between staying updated and not interrupting your device\u2019s flow. Delayed Time:Giving your device more time before it restarts might mean some updates chill out for a bit. Not forever, though. It will trigger the device to forcefully reboot after the grace period is over. Security Risks: Restarts that are delayed for a long time may expose devices to security flaws that can be mitigated with timely updates. User Ignorance: Some users may not fully understand the importance of applying updates. They might postpone restarts for an extended period of time, unknowingly putting their device at risk. Conclusion The user can snooze until the restart countdown is reached. Intune\u2019s Restart Grace Period is like a trusty sidekick that helps you stay updated without causing chaos in your environment. Just remember: while it\u2019s awesome, finding that sweet spot for your device\u2019s grace period is the name of the game.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/enhancing-your-security-posture-key/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Enhancing Your Security Posture: Key Practices for Organizations Welcome to the complete guide to understanding your organization\u2019s security posture and how it relates to security practice. This guide covers the hows and whys of security posture, such as how to perform a security posture assessment, ensure preventative measures are taken to protect your organization and explain why you should care. First, let\u2019s start by getting a good understanding of what \u201csecurity posture\u201d really means. What is security posture? According to theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), security posture refers to the security status of an enterprise\u2019s networks, information, and systems based on information security resources. More clearly defined, security posture is all about your organization\u2019s ability to identify, respond to, and recover from security threats and potential security risks. From the day-to-day security tasks to responding to enterprise-wide cyber threats, security posture gets to the heart of security at your organization. Security posture considerations The security posture of your organization considers its overall security level. This encompasses not only how executives, managers, and employees view and handle security measures, procedures, and issues but also the daily tasks meant to keep your organization secure. These daily tasks can be anything from scheduling external penetration tests and internal audits, to holding annual meetings for management to review the organization\u2019s cybersecurity strategy, to reviewing security log data from your access management system. All of these tasks and more play an integral part in an organization\u2019s security posture. Security posture assessments can also be determined by the key security metrics underlying your organization\u2019s systems and services. This differs from how your organization handles secure coding practices, security risks, updates, and the like; instead, the metrics focus on how the organization\u2019s infrastructure was built and continues to be. Security posture also considers the security risks of third parties and vendors that your organization chooses to partner with. Unfortunately, insecure third parties may create an additional attack surface for your organization\u2019s sensitive systems, allowing bad actors access into your environment. For this reason, your organization needs an overall security strategy that includes a vendor management program. The program should include written agreements by security professionals regarding data security, service uptime, and security incident response. Why is it so important? Each aspect discussed so far helps define your organization\u2019s security posture. Next, we\u2019ll explainwhya security posture assessment is so important for organizations. Help your organization understand its strengths and weaknesses Knowing your organization\u2019s security posture is important: it gives you a clear understanding of how ready and able your organization is to respond to security threats and prioritize security risks. An assessment of your organization\u2019s current security posture allows you to clearly define what your organization is doing well and where it can improve. Ultimately, it is in an organization\u2019s best interest to have as secure a posture as possible. Another reason security posture is so important is because it is reflected to your organization\u2019s stakeholders. While many may think shareholders are the only security stakeholders, the group also includes employees and customers. Each of these stakeholders needs to understand your security controls so they can make critical decisions about working for, procuring, or investing in your organization. Typically, key stakeholders such as customers and shareholders are interested in whether your organization completes basic risk mitigation actions. These actions improve an organization\u2019s security posture, allowing investors and customers to have faith that your organization is ready to face all levels of cybersecurity threats, from viruses to data breaches. They don\u2019t want to get caught up with an organization that has an insecure posture and could potentially expose their data and invade customer privacy. The bottom line is this: if you don\u2019t have a secure posture, you\u2019re not going to attract as many customers. You may have the best product, customer service, and ratings, but in a world full of bad actors and hackers, if you\u2019re not secure, then customers will look elsewhere. It\u2019s no secret that organizations with a secure posture are more likely to succeed. In fact, with the increasing frequency of major security incidents across all sectors, your security program matters now more than ever. Threat actors are on the constant lookout for insecure organizations to target. Your organization is an easy target if you have an insecure security posture, which can lead to fines, reputational damage, and more. When such high stakes are on the line, the last thing you want to worry about is hackers stealing your organization\u2019s sensitive information or, even worse, your customers\u2019 information. Security posture assessment: how to determine your organization\u2019s security posture Determining where you stand when it comes to security posture is very important. This will require you to take a look at your entire organization. Questions you may ask are: What security controls are in place? Is our underlying code secure? Who oversees security on an executive and day-to-day basis? Is each team abiding by your security programs? And more. Answering these questions will help determine where you stand. Below are some areas to consider when evaluating and determining your cybersecurity posture: Several industries are required by law to abide by specific security requirements. For example, healthcare companies in the US must abide by HIPPA, which stipulates specific requirements regarding patient data. It\u2019s in your best interest to ensure that your company\u2019s security posture complies with all industry security requirements. Additionally, various countries and geographic areas around the world require adherence to a specific set of security requirements, especially when your organization handles customer data in any amount and any way. An example of this would be the EU and GDPR, which are laws that protect the privacy and security of personal data of those located in the EEA. As such, it would be prudent to determine if the specific country or geographic location(s) in which your organization operates is subject to any security requirements. Some security certifications are more general, and organizations can benefit from having them. As the certifications are issued by a third party and evaluated by a standard set of security controls, they allow stakeholders to confidently see your organization as secure. Some examples of these certifications are ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, and more. Other documents that can help you determine your security posture include the privacy policy, standard Terms of Service agreements, and customer contracts. These externally facing documents typically outline the security practices of your organization, how data is handled, and what rights customers have in relation to doing business with your organization. Another place to look is in your organization\u2019s internal security documentation, such as an ISMS (Information Security Management System). This will include organization-specific security strategies and procedures, including security architecture, password policies, internal logging and monitoring, security training, account management, vulnerability management, change management, and so on. Security Practices vs Security Posture While closely related, security posture and security practices are not the same. Security practices encompass the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly tasks employees perform to keep your organization secure These tasks include continuous monitoring of audit logs, updating third-party applications, reviewing IDP/IDS policies, educating employees about security education, completing internal audits, scheduling external penetration tests, working with auditors on security certifications, meeting with top executives to update internal security policies, and maintaining industry certifications. Although most security practices are handled by the IT and Security teams, every employee is responsible for the organization\u2019s security. Your organization is most secure when each employee understands and takes security risks seriously. What does a strong security posture look like? A strong security posture looks like your organization is completing all the large and small security practices it takes to make your organization secure. Of course, strengthening your security posture takes time and effort. However, maintaining a strong security posture not only bolsters your organizations reputation, but also deters bad actors. Steps to Strengthen Security Posture To strengthen your security posture, you must first know where you are posture-wise. Look at your overall security. What security practices are you currently doing well? Where can you improve? What security certifications, documentation, and requirements do you have? Which do you need? A crucial part of a security posture assessment is evaluating your people. How many employees in your organization directly contribute to security tasks? Are they over- or under-worked? What about your other employees? Do they take security seriously? Do they need additional training and accountability? All of these questions are necessary for determining your current security posture. Although ideal, implementing all security best practices right away is not realistic. Therefore, the second part of strengthening your security posture is determining from your evaluation what to implement and when. Each organization is different, so determine what will provide the best ROI for your organization and do that first. For example, do you need to meet a country-specific security requirement? If so, tackle that task before you move on to other, and possibly less urgent, security tasks. After determining what your organization needs to implement, you need to create an action plan. Your action plan needs to include, at a minimum, roles and responsibilities, specific tasks, and due dates. Determining not only what you need to do, but who in your organization is going to do it is of paramount importance. Creating a timeline can help those individuals with assigned tasks complete them in a timely manner. Executing your action plan is much easier when it\u2019s detailed and specific. As individuals in your organization work on the specific tasks they\u2019ve been assigned, you can start to see your security controls improve. Consistent evaluation over time should be part and parcel of your execution. Evaluations can include timeliness, quality, and next steps. For example, are employees able to complete the tasks on time? Do timelines need to be adjusted? Were tasks assigned to the right employees? Did they report on their progress? Yet one of the most important questions to ask yourself in the execution and evaluation phase is: are the security practices implementedactuallyhelping our organization have a more secure posture? Once you know the answer to this question, you can decide what tasks strengthened your security posture the most. And the final step of this process? Rinse and repeat. Go back to your original security posture assessment. What security practices can be implemented next? What is the ROI for these? How can you best implement these practices? And the cycle continues. What is cloud security posture management? Cloud services are nothing new to organizations, but the security surrounding cloud services can affect an organization\u2019s security posture. Cloud security frameworks are extremely important and-similar to other parts of your security program-can either attract or repel attackers. Depending how an organization uses cloud services can determine the organization\u2019s approach to cloud security posture management. Some things to keep in mind with cloud security are: Where information is hosted? How secure is the host? Is any data publicly accessible? Can your organization be affected by data breaches of the cloud services? And more. These questions will help you determine what security practices you need to implement in order to keep your organization in a secure position. Just as you did before, evaluate, plan, and execute on the security items of the most value to your security posture. This will ensure your cloud security posture is as strong as it can be and as quick as possible. Overall security posture and practices By implementing all of the secure best practices as defined by the industry (such as CISA and NIST) and following any industry-specific security requirements, your organization is well on its way to improving and keeping a highly secure posture.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/curated-vs-crowdsourced/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Curated vs. Crowdsourced: Why Enterprise Software Catalogs Require Professional Curation Imagine you are Scotty, the Chief Engineer aboard the Starship Enterprise, a vessel where every component has been meticulously designed, rigorously tested, and fine-tuned to perform flawlessly at warp speed. Now imagine stepping away for well-earned shore leave. While you are gone, Captain Kirk, ever eager to push the limits, decides to \u201cupgrade\u201d the warp drive by installing new components he picked up from a Pakled freighter. The Pakleds, well-meaning but not exactly known for their technical expertise, had cobbled together parts from across the galaxy with little understanding of how they truly worked. At first, everything seems fine. The Enterprise can even outrun a Klingon bird of prey in a straight chase. But without proper schematics, thorough testing, and trusted engineering standards, cracks start to appear. Systems that were once seamless begin to behave unpredictably. Power fluctuations ripple through the ship. Critical subsystems falter under stress. What looked like a quick improvement turns into a growing liability, putting the entire crew at risk when it matters most. This is exactly the risk organizations take when they rely on community-maintained software catalogs as their primary source for application management. What seems like a shortcut to speed and convenience can quickly undermine the stability, security, and reliability of the entire enterprise. Trust Is Earned Through Process and Validation, Not Popularity Consider how we\u2019ve come to trust Microsoft\u2019s update ecosystem. From the early days of Windows Update and WSUS through today\u2019s more sophisticated Configuration Manager and Azure Update Manager solutions, Microsoft has built credibility with us \u2013 despite occasional missteps like the circular dependency nightmare of the 2019 Servicing Stack Updates. This trust stems from Microsoft\u2019s substantial investment in engineering teams who systematically validate updates across thousands of hardware and software configurations. What\u2019s noteworthy isn\u2019t that Microsoft\u2019s update process is flawless (it clearly isn\u2019t), but rather that organizations still trust it enough to deploy updates enterprise-wide. This trust has been earned through transparency, consistent remediation of issues, and the establishment of multi-stage validation processes that catch most problems before they reach production environments. We trust that when an update appears in the Microsoft Update catalog, it has been through rigorous testing for stability, security, and compatibility. This level of assurance is not just a nice-to-have, it\u2019s a necessity that allows enterprises to safely automate large-scale deployments without second-guessing the behavior and outcome of every update. Despite Microsoft\u2019s extensive resources, occasional issues still arise with their updates (another hat tilt to SSU\u2019s). This highlights a crucial point \u2013if even Microsoft, with its vast engineering teams and testing infrastructure, can face challenges with updates they directly produce and control, imagine the vastly higher risks from community repositories with volunteer maintainers and no formal validation processes. Professional third-party application curation demands even greater care and elevates validation and testing to a specialized discipline. A well-managed software catalog enables enterprise-grade verification across the complex ecosystem of third-party applications, delivering the stability and security that community repositories simply cannot match.

The Temptation Of Easy Wins You\u2019re stretched thin, juggling too many responsibilities while leadership keeps piling on more demands.

Suddenly, those bold promises about a new patching solution with access to a gazillion apps sound like salvation rather than a sales pitch. It\u2019s a familiar scenario. Both vendors and community solutions that rely heavily on crowdsourced repositories dangle the irresistible carrot of \u201cmassive software catalogs\u201d with tens of thousands of applications available at your fingertips. The numbers are impressive, the interface can look slick, and the convenience factor is undeniable. No wonder so many experienced IT professionals take the bait when it comes to decision making for a patching solution. When you\u2019re drowning in work, the promise of simplifying just one aspect of your job is almost impossible to resist. Beneath the Surface: What You\u2019re Really Getting When you adopt a solution that relies on community repositories as your primary patching solution, you\u2019re not just accepting convenience, you\u2019re entering into a trade-off that deserves careful consideration. Technology giants have grappled with this problem for years. Microsoft\u2019s efforts with MSIX, and their newer Enterprise Application Management initiative reflect just how hard it is to solve third-party application management at scale. A critical question often overlooked is this \u2013 \u201cWho is actually maintaining these packages?\u201d While community repositories can provide access to a wide range of applications, it\u2019s important to understand their limitations in the context of the enterprise:- Varying Maintenance ModelsMany packages are maintained by volunteers and individuals who donate their spare time. While these contributors are often passionate and skilled, they typically lack the resources, testing environments, or enterprise experience to maintain production-grade standards consistently across thousands of applications. Inconsistent Quality AssuranceWithout formalized QA processes, quality can vary dramatically between packages. Some may be meticulously maintained, while others might receive minimal attention or testing. Limited Enterprise AccountabilityCommunity repositories generally operate without service-level agreements, formal support channels, or guaranteed response times for critical issues \u2013 elements that enterprise environments depend on for operational stability. Supplementary RoleCommunity repositories can serve as valuable supplementary sources for non-critical applications or specialized tools, but relying on them as your primary patching mechanism for mission-critical software introduces unnecessary risk. Ticking a BoxIt\u2019s relatively easy to tick a box in an automation pipeline and mark an update as \u201csuccessful\u201d when it installs without obvious errors, but this surface-level validation often fails to consider crucial enterprise concerns. Were major version upgrades honoured appropriately? Were different product variants considered? Were dependencies installed? Did the app need to be closed for the updated to install successfully? Organizations must evaluate whether \u201ccommunity-maintained\u201d meets their requirements for accountability, consistency, and enterprise readiness. There\u2019s a significant difference between leveraging community resources as one component of a patching strategy versus making them the foundation of your security posture.one component of a patching strategy versus making them the foundation of your security posture. When Minutes Matter, Days Are Lost Security updates are a race against time. Every minute between a vendor\u2019s patch release and your organization\u2019s deployment represents a widening vulnerability window, making timely and informed decision making critical. Specifically, but not exclusively, community repositories can lag severely behind vendor new version releases. Failing to push out third-party software updates quickly can lead to difficult conversations with your security team, especially when they trace a breach back to a known vulnerability that remained unpatched because you relied on an unpredictable update source. Even worse, if a vendor releases an update that breaks key functionality, will anyone quickly identify and immediately pull that version from the community repository to prevent it from spreading across your organization? Inherent Risks in Crowdsourced Repositories Community repositories, like WinGet, can face inherent risks that professional curation directly addresses. Consider one real-world case of EarTrumpet. In 2021, developers discovered their manifest had been \u201cincorrectly altered\u201d without their knowledge, causing development binaries to be distributed to all WinGet users for over six weeks. When the issue was reported, the developer noted they \u201clegally owned the manifest\u201d yet had no control over changes made to it. https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/issues/7836 This incident outlines one of the fundamental weakness in crowdsourced models. Even with WinGet\u2019s improved security protocols and validation process today, including virus scanning and human review, the underlying challenges persist. Updates remain, primarily, community maintained \u2013 meaning security patches depend entirely on volunteers or publishers themselves. This creates inconsistent response times and unclear accountability when issues arise. Its also note worthy to mentionhttps://repology.orgat this point. Repology, monitor several package repositories, including WinGet, evaluating package versions and identifying potentially vulnerable software. Microsoft has a \u201cRepology\u201d badge in the WinGet repository README, which publicly displays metrics including \u201cvulnerable\u201d packages associated with known CVEs. https://repology.org/repository/winget WinGet intentionally supports multiple versions of the same software that might be installed side-by-side. This is particularly important for development tools like Python, .NET runtimes, and Java SDKs where developers often need to maintain multiple versions of an app simultaneously. Crowdsourced package managers can facilitate the deployment newer versions alongside existing ones rather than replacing them entirely. This \u201cside-by-side\u201d installation approach creates invisible security gaps. It means that even after upgrading to the latest version, vulnerable binaries from previous installations may remain on your system. While multiple versions are sometimes necessary in development environments, they require careful management and scrutiny in a production setting. Java is a perfect example of this problem. When newer versions are installed, older vulnerable Java runtimes often remain on disk, potentially exposing systems to known exploits. Organizations relying on community-maintained repositories must implement additional security processes to verify that outdated components are completely removed and not just supplemented with newer versions. The Unseen Testing Gap Another significant challenge with crowdsourced packages is what you cannot see, the testing gap. A new update might pass a virus scan and install on a test machine without throwing an obvious error. Great \u2013 lets install it. But wait, those are only the first steps. In a real enterprise, there are other critical phases in the quality assurance cycle and questions to answer:- Did the application install silently, without popping up any prompts to the user? Was the exit code captured correctly, and was it handled the right way? Did the new version properly upgrade the old one, or did it install side-by-side (which some vendors allow)? Was any special scripting needed to make the upgrade succeed? Does the package properly patch minor versions without jumping devices up to an unintended major version? This is something that could be disastrous for sensitive software like VPN clients. Are updates classified correctly? Are updates that address specific CVEs classified asCriticalfor example? It is not guaranteed that applications in community repositories are tested for these things. Real regression testing is crucial for any update released to a software catalog. Without any of the above validation, using crowdsourced updates is a gamble. Sometimes it works just enough to give a false sense of security. Sometimes it quietly cripples your environment and by the time you notice, the damage is already done. We Are Doing It Ourselves: A Free Lunch Some organizations don\u2019t even opt for a third-party solution at all and rely solely on harvesting community software catalogs and scripting there way to compliance. You should not underestimate the operational cost of manually maintaining third-party applications. The monitoring process alone is challenging and time-consuming. Simply becoming aware that a vendor has released an update requires constant vigilance across multiple channels. Once identified, enterprise environments typically require around 5 hours of work per application to properly handle an update. This includes downloading the installer, testing it thoroughly in isolated environments, packaging it correctly for deployment, and finally pushing it out to endpoints. Each step introduces potential complications and delays. If you manage a conservative 100 applications, and each vendor releases just 3 updates per year, the math quickly adds up: 5 hours \u00d7 100 applications \u00d7 3 updates per year = 1,500 hours annually. Without professional patching solutions, managing third-party updates can consume thousands of hours each year, not including the additional time needed to monitor vendors, manage exceptions, troubleshoot failures, and respond to unexpected issues. And the more applications you support, the larger this operational burden becomes. This is precisely why organizations turn to professional solutions that dramatically reduce this time investment.

Feature Benefits and ROI \u2013 Patch My PC Compliance: The Invisible Minefield Compliance frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and Cyber Essentials impose strict requirements for controlling, validating, and documenting the sources of third-party software. Leveraging community repositories alone will not provide the level of transparency or assurance needed to meet these standards. If your organization is audited, you could be expected to demonstrate:- Who packaged each critical application What testing was performed before deployment When vulnerabilities were identified and how they were addressed Using a professionally curated software catalog does not automatically fulfil all compliance requirements, but it significantly strengthens your ability to answer these questions. A curated software catalog enables validation of update behaviors through thorough assessment, testing, and documentation, offering a level of assurance and traceability that community repositories typically cannot match.

We prioritize meaningful expansion driven by customer needs, ensuring that every new application meets strict standards for quality, security, and enterprise deployment readiness. We are not just throwing in different apps and versions to inflate the software catalog artificially. Expertise That Can\u2019t Be Automated While automation plays a vital role in modern patch management, there\u2019s an irreplaceable value in human expertise and experience. At Patch My PC, our software catalog team represents a collective repository of tribal knowledge built through years of hands-on experience with thousands of applications across diverse enterprise environments. This accumulated wisdom creates value that no algorithm or community repository can match, with key benefits like:- Institutional MemoryOur team maintains detailed knowledge of application behaviors across versions \u2013 remembering that Adobe Reader 10.2 had a critical silent install parameter change, or that a certain VPN client\u2019s 2023 Q2 update caused authentication issues in specific configurations.

Vendor Relationship IntelligenceThrough years of working with software vendors, our team understands the nuances of different vendors\u2019 release patterns, documentation practices, and common deployment challenges. We know which vendors frequently change their installation frameworks, and which ones require special handling for enterprise environments. We also regularly work with vendors to help them improve their installers so they can be deployed successfully across the Enterprise. Pattern RecognitionHuman experts excel at spotting subtle patterns across seemingly unrelated applications. Our software catalog team can identify potential compatibility issues between applications that automated testing might miss, applying insights from one application family to anticipate problems in another. Judgement CallsNot every decision in patch management has a clear right answer. Captain Kirk never solely relied on Data (pun intended), he relied on collective knowledge (not from the Borg) to make clear decisions. Some updates require weighing security improvements against potential business disruption. Our dedicated software catalog team makes these impact analysis judgment calls based on years of experience and relevant data, helping many organizations navigate these complex trade-offs with confidence. Continuous Knowledge TransferOur team don\u2019t just package applications, they document their findings, create knowledge bases, and build processes that improve how updates are handled in the future. This institutional knowledge becomes part of our service, benefiting all customers. While automation and AI will continue to advance, the human element, real professionals who understand not just the technical aspects but the business implications of patch management, remains the cornerstone of truly enterprise-grade solutions. Conclusion: Rethink the Real Cost of Convenience The market is seeing an increase of products promising easy third-party application management, leveraging community software catalogs as their primary update source. Even Microsoft\u2019s own Enterprise Application Management solution struggles in this space \u2013 showing that this technology area is anything but easy to tame. The real question isn\u2019t whether you can afford a professional solution. It\u2019s whether you can afford the risks of continuing without one. Remember,\u201cCrowdsourcing gets you fast.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-mdm-url-missing/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Automatic enrollment for Windows: The Missing MDM Enrollment URL This blog explores why Windows Autopilot devices refused to enroll into MDM/Intunedespite successfully joining Entra ID. The funny thing? Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment worked (White Glove), but user-driven enrollment didn\u2019t.By analyzingdsregcmd, Fiddler, CloudDomainJoin.js, and Graph API, we uncovered a hidden issue blocking the MDM enrollment during Windows Autopilot. No MDM Enrollment during Windows Autopilot Deploying Windows devices through user-driven Autopilot should be straightforward (It should\u2026). The device joins Entra ID, enrolls into Intune, and receives policies automatically. However, in this case, something was off. After logging in, the device briefly displayed \u2018Please wait while we set up your device\u2018 but then skipped the Enrollment Status Page entirely and jumped straight to Windows Hello setup. No policies were coming down, no Intune management Extension, and no indication that the device had enrolled into MDM. Strangely, when testing Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployments, everything worked as expected. The device joined Entra ID, enrolled in Intune, and successfully applied policies. Somehow, Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployments bypassed the issue by relying on device attestation, which does not require themdm_enrollment_url.User-driven enrollment, however,relies entirely on this URLto determine where to enroll. Since it was missing, the process never even began. Dsregcmd: No MDM Enrollment URL The first step was confirming whether the device had successfully joined Entra ID and received the necessary MDM enrollment URLs. Running dsregcmd /status provided immediate insight. The output confirmed that the device was joined to Entra ID, single sign-on was enabled, and the correct tenant ID was assigned. However, as shown below, one crucial detail was missing. There were no MDM enrollment URLs present. This was a major red flag. If a device is configured forautomatic MDM enrollment,it should receive an MDM enrollment URL during authentication. Without it, the device had no instructions on where to enroll for management. Trying to enroll the device manually without MDM urls configured just led to a failed Intune enrollment. That makes sense! But the moment wemanually specified the MDM URLswith a PowerShell script, as shown below, and kicked off the enrollment, it worked!! The moment wemanually entered MDM URLs and enrollment worked, that wasa major cluethat Intune itself was fine. Thisdirectly provedthe issue waswith automatic enrollment, not Intune. Checking MDM Enrollment Scope and License Since the device lacked an MDM enrollment URL, the next logical step was verifying whether the MDM user scope in Entra ID was set correctly and whether the user had the necessary Intune P1 license. As shown below, the MDM scope was correctly set to \u201cAll users\u201d for automatic MDM enrollment. With the MDM scope being configured to all, we also checked if the user had the required Microsoft Intune P1 license and Intune License, which is necessary for automatic MDM enrollment. Even after verifying these settings, dsregcmd /status still did not show any MDM enrollment URLs. Investigating CloudDomainJoin.js Since the Entra ID join itself wasn\u2019t failing(which happened in this blog), the next logical step was investigating CloudDomainJoin.js, the component responsible for handling MDM discovery after a device joins Entra ID. Normally, this process begins with the Entra ID join request, followed by the negotiation of device capabilities with the server. Once completed, the ID token should include the mdm_enrollment_url. If present, the device requests an MDM Delegation Token, which triggers Intune enrollment. The MDM Flow explained The Corrosponding Documentation to the flow Device Joins Entra ID: CloudDomainJoin starts as part of the enrollment flow. Extracts and Decodes ID Token: TheID tokenshould contain the mdm_enrollment_url for Intune. MDM URL Check: Ifmdm_enrollment_url is present, CloudDomainJoin:Requests an MDM Delegation Tokenfrom Entra ID.Receives anaccess token for the MDM service(enrollment.manage.microsoft.com).Calls theMDM enrollment URIto start enrollment. Requests an MDM Delegation Tokenfrom Entra ID. Receives anaccess token for the MDM service(enrollment.manage.microsoft.com). Calls theMDM enrollment URIto start enrollment. Ifmdm_enrollment_url is missing, theMDM Delegation Token is never requested, meaningIntune enrollment does not happen. MDM Enrollment Request: If the process succeeds, thedevice is enrolled in Intune,andESP starts. If it fails,the device remains unmanaged. As explained above, the ID token is important in this process. If we examine the Dsreg.dll more closely, we will notice the same. DSREG.DLL As shown below, the dsreg.dll contains an important function that parses the ID token from the JSON response and tries to find the MDM_enrollment uris inside thatIDToken. In this case, the ID token was missing mdm_enrollment_url entirely. This meant that the system never attempted to request an MDM Delegation Token, stopping the enrollment process before it even began. With the mdm_enrollment_url missing from the IDToken, we needed to determine whether this was aprocessing issueor whether Entra ID was failing to provide the URL entirely. That meant diving into a Fiddler trace to inspect the authentication response. Capturing a Fiddler Trace To confirm what was happening, we captured a Fiddler trace during authentication. This allowed us to see exactly what the device was sending to Entra ID and what Entra ID was returning. First let me show you what should have happened the moment you join the device to Entra: Note: You can download the png for a better view! As shown above, the moment the device asks for the device.join access token, the MDM enrollment urls should be in the IDToken. From then on, it should ask for the MDM_delegaton token to kick off the Intune Enrollment. We will notice something weird if we compare the working one with the one we got from this broken enrollment. When examining the response from login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/token, we expected to find mdm_enrollment_url in the ID token, but it was missing in action. This confirmed that Entra ID failed to provide the necessary information for enrollment. Resetting MDM Scope and Verifying MDM Authority To eliminate misconfigurations, we fully reset the MDM scope and enrollment URLs in the Intune portal. The MDM URLs were reset, the MDM scope was disabled and then re-enabled, and the settings were saved again to enforce changes. Additionally, we verified that the MDM authority was correctly set to Intune, as misconfigurations in MDM authority can sometimes prevent devices from enrolling. As shown below, the MDM Authority was set to Intune, so this wasn\u2019t the issue. Even after resetting everything and checking the MDM authority, the issue persisted. We attempted another enrollment attempt, hoping the reset had resolved the issue, but the device still failed to retrieve the MDM enrollment URL. It was clear that the root cause lay deeper within Entra ID. Investigating Entra ID\u2019s MDM Policies and Conditional Access Next, we checked the MDM policies in Entra ID. The portal showed Microsoft Intune as the only MDM provider, but something looked strange. The Microsoft Intune name contained an unusual period, which raised questions about whether something had changed in its configuration. Opening the Microsoft Intune MDM policy also showed us no obvious errors. The Microsoft Intune service Principle was enabled as it should. Somehow, I was expecting it to be disabled. To be sure we were indeed looking at the right MDM policy (as it contained a weird . in the name), we tried to add the Microsoft Intune MDM policy, but that one failed with the message that it had already been configured for a single sign-in of Microsoft Entra ID. To rule out external interference, we checked Conditional Access policies. If a policy required multi-factor authentication, compliance enforcement, or additional conditions before device registration, it could silently block enrollment. We temporarily excluded the user from all Conditional Access policies to eliminate this possibility. However, the issue remained even after these changes. Since the user and MDM enrollment were fully excluded from all Conditional Access policies, the mdm_enrollment_url was still missing, which confirmed that CA wasnot interferingwith the process. The issue had to be deeper, inside Entra ID itself. Checking MDM Policies with Graph API Since the Entra ID portal wasn\u2019t showing any obvious issues, we queried the Graph API for the policy ID that belongs to the Microsoft Intune MDM. After executing the above PowerShell command, it became clear that the Microsoft Intune MDM policy was valid even when the display name contained a weird \u201c.\u201d After focusing on the original Microsoft Intune MDM policy, we opened the graph explorer, but this time, we asked for a full list of MDM policies. Running the command: GEThttps://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/mobileDeviceManagementPolicies Among the results, we found an invisible, invalid MDM policy (IsValid: False). The policy was marked as invalid and had a null discovery URL. This explained a bit why it wasn\u2019t visible in Entra ID and why it had not provided the MDM enrollment URL during authentication. Why I mentioned a bit? Well, who can explain to me how the Entra background service uses an Invalid MDM policy to find the enrollment urls? In my opinion it should have skipped that one because\u2026 yes! It is Invalid! Fixing the Issue Once we identified the root cause, the solution was straightforward. The invalid MDM policy needed to be deleted. Using Graph API, we ran the following command to remove it: DELETEhttps://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/mobileDeviceManagementPolicies/f6ddc682-c885-45e3-beba-67f8eb99de56 After deleting the invalid policy, we performed a get command again. This time, no invalid MDM policy showed up! After removing the invalid MDM policy, we reinstalled the device. Guess what happened? After entering our credentials, the device joined Entra, but this time, it showed us what we were waiting for: the Enrollment Status Page (ESP)! Since Entra ID does not just use a single MDM policy but instead scans all available ones, the presence of an invalid policy caused it to skip issuing mdm_enrollment_url. Once removed, the correct MDM policy was applied, and enrollment proceeded as expected. In other words, the system failed not because Intune was misconfigured but because it selected a broken policy over a valid one. Conclusion: Lessons Learned This case highlights an issue that cannot be detected in the Entra ID portal alone. When devices join Entra ID but fail to enroll in Intune, a deeper investigation is needed. Checking dsregcmd /status helps verify if MDM URLs are missing. Capturing a Fiddler trace allows confirmation of what Entra ID is sending in authentication responses. Querying Graph API helps uncover hidden or misconfigured policies that may interfere with enrollment. Sometimes, the issue isn\u2019t where you expect it to be. It may be buried deep in the backend, waiting to be found.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/delivery-optimization-autopilot-troubleshooting-journey/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Delivery Optimization and Autopilot: A Troubleshooting Journey This blog will focus on how one simple Delivery Optimization Policy in Intune could mess up all of your Autopilot and Autopilot (AP-DP) enrollments. Introduction SomeAutopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP)failures are easy to diagnose. A misconfigured application (detection rules), a firewall blocking network requests (or WNS being blocked), or a not responding DNS server could really break your enrollments. But what happens when everything seems fine, yet the deployment still refuses to finish successfully? That was exactly the scenario we stumbled into. In this case, multiples devices that appeared to be properly configured somehow failed theAutopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP)enrollment. As shown below, the AP-DP enrollment showed us that it couldn\u2019t complete the device setup. There were no obvious failures or apparent network issues, yet the Windows Autopilot Device Preparation deployment refused to continue. Identifying the Stalled App with AP-DP Monitor To narrow down the issue, we used theAutopilot Device Preparation Monitorin Intune, which helps track where the AP-DP provisioning process gets stuck. The monitor quickly revealed thatMicrosoft 365 Apps for Enterprise (Office)was the application causing the delay and eventually Autopilot to fail. Sincethe Microsoft 365 Apps was a required app, AP-DP would not finish successfully until it was installed. That gave us our first clue: something was preventing Office from completing its installation. I know theOffice/MS365 CSP optionis pretty well known to break apart during deployments, but my gut told me it was something else. Examining Running Processes in the Task Manager Before diving into logs, we checkedTask Managerduring the deployment to see what was happening with the Office installation. Sure enough, theClick-to-Run (OfficeClickToRun.exe) setup was running, but it wasn\u2019t doing anything else. The process appeared to bewaitingfor something before continuing. This suggested that the Office installer wasn\u2019t completely failing; it was juststuck in a stalled state, unable to continue. Is this going to be anotherEnergy Saver issue, like we noticed some time ago, or again, something else??? At this point, network issues were still considered a potential cause. If the installer was unable to fetch the required files, it would sit idle, waiting for a retry. Not again DNS!!! ? Checking CDN Access Before Analyzing Installation Logs Since Office downloads its installation files from Microsoft\u2019sContent Delivery Network (CDN), we needed to rule out any network-related issues. (if it\u2019s not DNS, it\u2019s probably DNS.). We firstretrieved the exact CAB file download URLfrom the logs that are located in the C:\\Windows\\Temp folder. Once we opened the logs, we started searching for the properCDN URL: This URL pointed to Microsoft\u2019s Office CDN, so we manually tested it by attempting to download the file directly through a browser. After entering the CDN URL in the browser, the CAB file was downloaded without any issues. With the file being downloaded successfully without issues, it confirmed that: \u00b7 The CDN was somehow accessible. \u00b7 There were no DNS or firewall blocks. \u00b7 The network was not interfering with the installation. With external network issues ruled out (well for 90%), we returned to the installation logs in the temp folder to investigate further. Analyzing Installation Logs and the First Red Flag After ensuring that network access / DNS wasn\u2019t the problem, we continued checking the log files. The key errors we found mentioned:Failed to Delete Native OOBE Keysand Besides the Native error we also spotted this error: Failed to delete WoW Oobe keys. At first, I had the stupid idea that I was looking at anoobecompletetimestampissue again, but when I scrolled down into the log file, I noticed something else. As shown above, the next error showed me that the download failed due to fatal error:0x80d02002. This indicated that the Office Setup itselffailed to retrieve its installation filesand saw no progress within the defined period. Instead, something on the device itself wasdelaying the download request, causing the process to stall indefinitely. The funny thing? This error code refers toDelivery Optimization (DO)! What Is Delivery Optimization? Delivery Optimization (DO) is Windows\u2019 built-in method for managing downloads by using peer-to-peer distribution. Instead of downloading content directly from Microsoft\u2019s servers every time, devices on the same network can share files to reduce bandwidth usage. If no peers are available, DO should fall back to downloading from the internet. However, this fallback behavior depends on policy settings. If configured incorrectly, the system may keep searching for peers instead of switching to HTTP immediately, which could cause application installation delays\u2026. as seen in our AP-DP deployments. Investigating Delivery Optimization as the Cause Since the logs confirmed that Office was waiting for its download, and combining this with the DO error0x80d02002, there was only one conclusion:Delivery Optimization (DO)seems to be interfering. If you are expecting delivery optimization to be the culprit, the best thing you can do is run the following PowerShell command:Get-DeliveryOptimizationStatus As shown below, this was the result we got when running the Get-DeliveryOptimizationStatus command. This DeliveryOptimization command confirmed our suspicion: Priority: Foreground BytesFromHttp = 0 (well that ain\u2019t good) NumPeers = 0 \u2013> No peer-to-peer sources were available.!! That meant the system was waiting for a peer-to-peer delivery that would never happen. Normally, if no peers are available, the system should fall back to a direct HTTP download. But it didn\u2019t switch to HTTP in a reasonable time; instead, it waited indefinitely (well, almost\u2026 after 60 minutes exactly, things started coming to life). To confirm the issue, we opened a browser and started checking theIntune Delivery Optimization Policy. Checking the Intune Delivery Optimization Policy We checked theIntune policy settingsapplied to the device. That\u2019s when we found the problem. The device had the followingDelivery Optimization policiesapplied: DO Delay Foreground Download from HTTP = 3600 seconds (1 hour) DO Delay Background Download from HTTP = 3600 seconds (1 hour) This wasthe hidden culprit. To be sure these settings were applied to the device, we also checked the policymanagercurrentdevicedeliveryoptimization registry key on the device. As expected, we noticed the same foreground delivery optimization settings. With this foreground setting configured to3600and Office being installed as a foreground application, it was required to waitup to an hourbefore switching from peer-to-peer to HTTP. The default and recommended value is 60,NOT 3600!We can spot the same in theDelivery OptimizationSettings documentation. Let me explain a bit more about foreground and background downloads from HTTP. How the MS365 Apps use Foreground and Background Delivery Optimization Unlike background updates, where downloads happen gradually, some installation processes requireimmediate accessto content. This is whereForeground and Background Delivery Optimization (DO)come into play. Understanding the differences between these two modes is important when deploying applications, specifically Microsoft 365 apps, during Autopilot. Understanding Foreground vs. Background DO Background DO (Low-Priority, Passive Downloads) Used forpassive updates, such asWindows Update fetching patchesin the background. The system downloads filesonly when resources allow, ensuring it doesn\u2019t impact other tasks. Example:(Think of downloading a game update while you\u2019re working, it\u2019s happening quietly in the background without slowing down your device.) Foreground DO (High-Priority, Immediate Downloads) Used whena process needs content immediately, such as when an installation or update requires fast access to files. These downloads takepriority over background tasksand must be completed as quickly as possible. Example:(Think of clicking \u201cInstall Now\u201d on an app, you want it immediately, so it downloads at full speed.) Microsoft\u2019s Known Issues with Foreground and Background DO Luckily, Microsoft has documented specificDelivery Optimization settingsthat could impact the Microsoft 365 Apps installation: Delay Background Download from HTTP\u2013 Controls how long the system waits before falling back to an internet download forbackground updates. Delay Foreground Download from HTTP\u2013 This is a Similar setting, but it applies to user-initiated updates (Foreground DO). Key issue:If these values are set too high (e.g.,5 minutes),user-initiated Office updates can be delayed, as the system keeps searching for peer devices instead of downloading immediately. How This Affects MS 365 Apps Installations Now, let\u2019s connect the dots. Microsoft 365 Apps installations during Autopilot rely on fast downloads, meaning they should useForeground DO. IfDelay Foreground Download from HTTP is misconfigured, an Office installation may wait unnecessarily instead of downloading immediately. Microsoft documentation confirms that this can delay installations by several minutes. This explains whyOffice installations may sometimes take longer than expected. It\u2019s not an issue with the MS 365 Apps themselvesbut rather how DO prioritizes and delays downloads. When you encourage your users to use the Company Portal to install the Microsoft 365 apps instead, that one could also be stuck downloading or installing If all of your apps are stuck on downloading or installing in the Company portal, you again need to check what Delivery Optimization is doing. In this case, the priority was set to background. Guess what happens if the Do Delay Background HTTP download is also set to 3600 Fixing the Delivery Optimization Policy The solution was pretty easy, as we only needed to adjust theDelivery Optimization policies toallow HTTP fallbackmuch sooner. We changed the values in Intune: DO Delay Foreground Download from HTTP \u2192 60 secondsDO Delay Background Download from HTTP \u2192 600 seconds After redeploying the test device, the results were immediate. The Microsoft 365 Apps began downloading within a minute and were installed successfully. With the Ms365 now being installed successfully, AP-DP proceeded without issues. Conclusion This Autopilot issue highlighted howDelivery Optimization misconfigurationscan silently break Autopilot deployments. The MS 365 Apps weren\u2019t failing due to network connectivity, DNS (Always DNS right?), or CSP misconfiguration, it was being delayed by a Delivery Optimization policy that forced it to wait too long before switching to HTTP downloads. Foreground downloads must switch to HTTP quickly if no peers exist. (60 Seconds) The AP-DP Monitor was crucial in identifying which app was failing. Log analysis (MS 365 App Install Log) confirmed that a single Intune policy was enough to block installation. This wasn\u2019t a regularEnrollment Status Page failure; it was an AP-DP issue that required understanding how the Ms365 Apps download interactedwith theDelivery Optimization policies.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/app-registrations-enterprise/", "title": "", "raw_text": "App Registrations and Enterprise Applications Microsoft\u2019s current documentation lacks a comprehensive explanation of Enterprise Applications and App Registrations, making it challenging for newcomers to grasp their significance and effectively manage them from a security perspective. This blog aims to bridge that gap by providing a clear understanding of what an App Registration and Enterprise Application is, empowering users to navigate security operations around app registrations and enterprise applications. This blog has 7 parts: Part 1: Understanding Enterprise Applications vs. App Registrations: Differentiating Key Concepts Part 2: Create Your Own App & Application Registration Part 3: Investigate Your First App Registration Part 4: Permissions Part 5: Register Your Enterprise Application in Another Tenant Part 6 Security & Application Permissions Part 7 Conclusion Part 1: Understanding Enterprise Applications vs. App Registrations: Differentiating Key Concepts AnEnterprise Applicationacts as a \u201c*linked instance\u201d within your tenant, connected to anApp Registration.ThisApp Registrationcan exist either within your own tenant or in another tenant. For instance, upon signing up atportal.patchmypc.comand receiving admin approval, anEnterprise Applicationis automatically created. This application is associated with anApp Registration, which is situated in Patch My PC\u2019s Azure tenant. Let\u2019s create your own Enterprise Application to deepen your comprehension of these concepts. The term \u201cThe Linked Instance\u201d was mentioned on a YouTube channel called BlueScreen Brothers, which you should really check out.Azure \u2013 App registration and Enterprise Applications \u2013 YouTube Part 2: Create Your Own App & Application Registration The first step we need to take is to create an App Registration in your Entra ID portal and make a new registration. In this example, we opt for the \u201cAccounts in any organizational directory\u201d option, creating aMulti-Tenant App Registration.We kept the Redirect URI field empty for this demonstration. That was straightforward and easy! You\u2019ve successfully generated your ownMulti-Tenant App Registration. Now, let\u2019s delve deeper into specific details. Part 3: Investigate your first app registration Let\u2019s look at the overview page of your app registration. Note the Application (client) ID. Now comes the surprise. By registering theApp Registration,anEnterprise Applicationwas also automatically created. Please note that theEnterprise Applicationshares the same Application ID as your app registration \u2013 in this case, 40569bd6-a9f0-476c-8375-f0ab25f8166d. Now, yourEnterprise Applicationis linked to anApp Registration, whether it\u2019s within the same tenant or a different one. Personally, I find the term \u201cEnterprise Azure Application\u201d confusing. I prefer to describe it as a linked instance within your tenant that connects to anApp Registration. Part 4: Permissions Understanding API Permissions is crucial, as it sheds light on the security implications of App Registrations and Enterprise Applications. Now, let\u2019s dive into configuring permissions for our application. Since an Enterprise Application is tied to the core App Registration in your tenant, where should we begin to set up our permissions? Naturally, it\u2019s the App Registration! Let\u2019s configure permissions specifically for Microsoft Graph: Navigate to your App Registration once more. Navigate to your App Registration once more. Click on \u201cAdd a permission\u201d. Click on \u201cAdd a permission\u201d. Choose \u201cMicrosoft Graph\u201d. Choose \u201cMicrosoft Graph\u201d. There are two API permissions to choose from. Delegated permissions Delegated permissions Application permissions Application permissions Delegated permissionsneed the user rights to function. The rights of the signed in user will be used. If the user does not have enough rights, the app will not have access. If the user has enough rights and is logged in, the app will have access on behalf of the user. Application permissionsyou give the rights to the service itself. There is no user interaction. Let\u2019s choose some simple delegated permissions: Email, OpenID, Profile. Notice the right column Admin Consent Required. That means that a user who is not an admin can grant consent for the app. These are considered safe permissions that a regular user can consent to. Let\u2019s create a permission that now needs administrator access: User.ReadWrite.All. I can already approve the consent for this tenant within the App Registration. We don\u2019t need to do that in this example. We are going to link from another tenant to theApp Registration. Part 5: Register your enterprise application in another tenant. The first set now is to generate a consent URL that we can use in another tenant. We need the app ID and must use the value \u201corganizations.\u201d More info ishereon Microsoft Learn. The URL must be formatted like this:https://login.microsoftonline.com/{organization}/adminconsent?client_id={client-id} We change {organization} to organizations (to make it multi tenant) and {client-id} to your application (client) ID. Which gives you an end result of: https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/adminconsent?client_id=40569bd6-a9f0-476c-8375-f0ab25f8166d Copy paste the URL in your browser with a web account profile from another tenant, and let\u2019s see what happens. Let\u2019s try to accept with a non-admin user. We get a permission request that\u2019s getting refused because we use delegated rights and we demand an API permission \u201cUser.Readwrite.All\u201d that needs admin rights. If we switch over to an admin user. We will see now API permissions that we can approve. Let\u2019s click accept. After clicking accept you will see an error because we don\u2019t have a reply url accepted. You can ignore this. If we go look in our Entra ID environment in our other tenant we will see that we created anEnterprise Applicationwith the sameApplication ID 40569bd6-a9f0-476c-8375-f0ab25f8166das ourApp Registrationfrom the source tenant. We\u2019ve just established a Service Principal in the alternate tenant. Much like a regular user, a Service Principal possesses specific permissions within your tenant. Thus, instead of crafting a user principal, we\u2019ve generated a service principal; your enterprise application is working as a service principal in the other tenant. Part 6 Security & Application Permissions We need to address security concerns because consenting to unverified application API permissions poses real risks. This practice opens avenues for potential phishing attacks to extract external user data or even request global admin access to another tenant. I strongly advise reviewing the consent and permissions page for Enterprise Applications and prohibiting user consent for apps altogether! When you adjust your enterprise registration in your source tenant to incorporate an application permission rather than a delegated permission for read and write access to all applications in your Intune tenant, additional cautionary notifications will surface. This app registration empowers an external service principal to establish an automated service with the capability to add and remove applications within your tenant. Since it\u2019s not a delegated permission, user login isn\u2019t even required. You\u2019d likely agree that it\u2019s crucial to monitor the permissions granted to service principals within your tenant carefully! Part 7 Conclusion After reading this blog, I hope you now have a better understanding of the difference between an App Registration and an Enterprise Application. To give you a brief summary: App Registrationis the global definition and configuration of an application. App Registrationis the global definition and configuration of an application. Enterprise Applicationis a local instance of the app registration (linked instance) within a specific tenant, used to manage and enforce permissions and policies for that tenant. Enterprise Applicationis a local instance of the app registration (linked instance) within a specific tenant, used to manage and enforce permissions and policies for that tenant. To finish the blog, being mindful of granting API permissions is vital due to potential security risks like data exposure and external service principal access. Regularly reviewing and managing permissions with Enterprise Applications is critical to maintaining security.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/sccm-co-management-dual-scan/", "title": "", "raw_text": "SCCM Co-management \u2013 Dual Scan and Scan Source Demystified This blog post will highlight some of the concepts around co-management, recap on what it actually is and detail how the Windows Update workload is affected by Dual Scan and the newer Scan Source policy. We won\u2019t go into how you can enable co-management or setup co-management, but you can view a great guide herehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/how-to-enable We will also spend some time looking at how you can still deliver 3rd-party patching from Configuration Manager whilst making use of the benefits of controlling Microsoft Updates from Intune. This is especially attractive if you want a super granular transition for managing your all your patching from Microsoft Intune. As a supplemental guide to fully understanding what co-management is, we recommend viewing this webinarCo-Management Moving Workloads to Intune Webinar \u2013 March 2023 \u2013 YouTube Accompanying Deckhttps://patchmypc.com/app/uploads/2025/06/2023-03-01-Co-management-Webinar-1.pptx Note:The Table of Contents can be found in the right side bar of this post when viewed from a desktop or at the top of the post when viewed from a mobile/tablet. What is co-management? Co-management is a feature that attaches Microsoft Configuration Manager clients to the Microsoft cloud. \u201cMoving to the Cloud\u201d means different things to each of us. Quite often our journey to the cloud is complex. There is no magic button that shifts everything from on-premises to the cloud and then mystically the operational bill is cut in half. Often the path is much more complex with multiple twists, decision making junctures and stepping stones that disappear into the bog of eternal stench with one wrong move. The Kool-Aid was served back-in-the-day when co-management was sold as one of the primary ways to move to the cloud. Co-management was never designed as a \u201clift and shift\u201d feature when it was first released with Configuration Manager 1710. Quite simply put, co-management allowed admins to start orchestrating their move to Microsoft Intune by allowing them to move specific workloads at a time from one management agent (SCCM Client) to another (Windows MDM). Both agents are \u201caware\u201d of the other so the orchestration works pretty well. It would only allow settings to be applied from one management agent \u2013 thus avoiding policy conflict from the two different MDM platforms. Co-management only works between the Configuration Manager client and the Windows MDM agent. To caveat that statement, the Intune Management Extension is also co-management aware, so technically there are 3 agents at play. Workloads Workloads is a concept that allows us to move individual \u201cworkloads\u201d from Configuration Manager to Intune. You can find the co-management settings in the Configuration Manager console under theAdministration > Cloud Services > Cloud Attachnode and on theWorkloadstab. What are the workloads we can move? The options have changed much over recent years, today we have the following:- Compliance Policies Device ConfigurationResource Access Policies(no longer supported in Configuration Manager)Endpoint Protection Resource Access Policies(no longer supported in Configuration Manager) Endpoint Protection Client Apps Office Click-2-Run Apps Windows Update Policies Microsoft has a great doc explaining what moving each of the these workloads means, we won\u2019t duplicate that information in this post. Go check outCo-management workloads \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn The great thing about workloads is that you can move them, individually, at a pace that suits you and your adoption of Microsoft Intune. 3rd-party updates workload? It is important to note that when you move the workload forWindows Update Policiesto Intune, you areonlymoving the workload for Microsoft 1st-party updates. When the Windows Update policy is moved to Intune, 3rd-party updates still come from Configuration Manager. 3rd-party updates are normally built as Win32 apps in Intune. In order to target updates to devices from Intune, as Win32 apps, you must set theClient Appsworkload to either Intune, or Pilot Intune. If you want to stop clients receiving 3rd-party updates from Configuration Manager, you should adjust your 3rd-party Software Update deployments to not target devices that have had their Windows Update workload moved to Intune. Alternatively, if you want a definitive stop to receiving 3rd-party updates from Configuration Manager, go ahead and disable Software Updates in Client Settings. In testing, this removed all the Windows Update policies and registry keys from the client that the Configuration Manager client had previously set. Be sure to check for tattooed policy that Geoff was responsible before when he created that GPO 74 years ago. The image below depicts the policy/registry key removed for Windows Update. Pilot Group One statement we hear often is \u201cI\u2019m not ready to move the Windows Update workload to Intune for all my Windows devices\u201d. The great news is you don\u2019t even have to move the workload for every windows device at once. Creating a pilot collection to target devices with co-management workloads is a great step to test the water. Stagingis used to select which collections will be targeted when the workload is moved to thePilot Intunephase. Capabilities Every co-management workload has an associated numerical value. We refer to this as thecapabilityvalue. You can very easily see the capability value assigned to the client in the Configuration Manager control panel applet and also theCoManagementHandler.loglog file. The available capability values changed drastically in Configuration manager 2111. If you like deep diving down rabbit holes, check out this post atCo-management Workloads and Capabilities (Revisited) (msendpointmgr.com) As different workloads are moved to Intune, the capability will be re-evaluated on the client and the value will change accordingly. This capability is how the different MDM agents/clients know which workload they should enforce or ignore. There is a known bug when the workload configurations are evaluated by the Configuration Manager client. You can see this error in theCoManagementHandler.log. Could not find one of the mandatory rulesFailed to merge/resolve rules. Error 0x8000ffffFailed to process GET for assignment (ScopeId_######/ConfigurationPolicy_###### : 1). Error 0x8000ffff To workaround this, simple evaluate the theCoMgmtSettingsProdconfigurationfirstbefore evaluating the configuration that failed. Policy conflict One of the early challenges, was correctly identifying policy conflicts when moving different workloads to Microsoft Intune. Unless you had very well documented policies, you would often find devices not applying policy correctly because of legacy Group Policy settings tattooed in the registry. This challenge still exists today as folks start to embrace co-management. TheMDMWinsOverGPConfiguration Service Provider (CSP) has been designed with good intention. It allows admins to control whether a CSP configured in Intune would win over an identical policy set locally. Unfortunately, this is only true if there is an equivalent CSP policy to override the local policy set by a Group Policy Object (GPO) or Configuration Baseline. Some \u201cleft over\u201d tattooed policies can actually break features, like Windows Update. Here are 3 examples of policies, that left configured on the device, will adversely affect/break Windows Update from working as you move the Windows Update workload to Microsoft Intune. NoAutoUpdate NoAutoUpddateis a setting that some admins would use to prevent duplicate Windows Update balloon notifications from appearing on Windows 7 devices. We don\u2019t see this policy used often anymore, we do still find this registry key tattooed in some customer environments. Enabling this policy, setting it to 1, will actually disable automatic updates. DisableDualScan DisableDualScanis one of the main focus points of this blog and it is another policy setting that can adversely affect the delivery of Windows Updates when you move workloads to Microsoft Intune in a co-management scenario. Enabling this policy does not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update. DisableDualScan is enabled (set to1) when the Windows Update workload is set to Configuration Manager. When you move the workload to Microsoft Intune, this value will change to0to allow the client to Dual Scan (against both the Windows Update Service and WSUS). If we runrsop.mscon the client we can see this policy enforced by Local Group Policy (via Configuration Manager.) Important:Dual Scan, is no longer supported on Windows 11. On Windows 10, it is replaced by the new Windows scan source policy. DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations Another breaking policy setting isDoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations. This setting will stop the client reaching out to the internet for Windows Updates. Note:This setting might be configured andintended. Some admins did enable this policy to prevent users \u201cChecking Online for Updates\u201d and downloading an un-planned Feature Update. Leaving this policy enabled will break stuff as you move the Windows Updates workload to Intune, so keep an eye out for it. Default AU Service As we step through different logs in this blog, it is important to note what the different Microsoft Update Service Manager services are. We can run a simple PowerShell cmdlet to view them. The service ID is particularly interesting when viewing the WindowsUpdate.log Note:To generate the WindowsUpdate.log on the desktop, run the PowerShell cmdletGet-WindowsUpdateLog The service ID\u2019s are:- 7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d = Microsoft Update 8b24b027-1dee-babb-9a95-3517dfb9c552 = DCat Flighting Prod 855e8a7c-ecb4-4ca3-b045-1dfa50104289 = Windows Store (DCat Prod) 3da21691-e39d-4da6-8a4b-b43877bcb1b7 = Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) 9482f4b4-e343-43b6-b170-9a65bc822c77 = Windows Update When viewing the WindowsUpdate.log, searching for the following line will tell you which service is being used for an update operation ProtocolTalker ServiceId = As the image below depicts, the WindowsUpdate.log has been filtered to show you how different services are contacted to check for different types of updates, depending on how Dual Scan (and Scan Source) has been configured. When Dual Scan has been enabled, the default automatic update service will be set to \u201cMicrosoft Update\u201d. If the workload has not been moved to Intune, the default automatic update service should still be set to \u201cWindows Server Update Services\u201d . The Windows Update Agent can switch between multiple services. The \u201cdefault\u201d service will give you an indication if the device is reaching out to the internet for updates to the Windows Update Service. If the default service is set to \u201cMicrosoft Update\u201d, it is a good indication that Dual Scan (or Scan Source) has been enabled. Dual Scan Dual Scan is perhaps the main reason we are at this party together. When the Windows Update workload is moved to Intune, Dual Scan is enabled. Dual Scan enables Windows 10 devices to scan both WSUS (on-premises) and the Windows Update service (a.k.a WU \u2013 or the cloud). Some other things need careful consideration when Dual Scan is enabled. 3rd-party patching Dual Scan is super beneficial for admins who want to make the most out of the Windows Update service in the cloud, via WUfB/Intune to intelligently manage the delivery of Microsoft, 1st-party, updates but who also want to ease into 3rd-party patching from the cloud a little slower. Companies like Patch My PC can deliver 3rd-party updates from Microsoft Intune as a Win32 app, which is pretty awesome, but customers also need to apply a little due diligent thought before making the move \u2013 especially if they have been patching from Configuration Manager successfully. This isn\u2019t to say the move isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s super simple, but there are some challenges that need consideration. As we mentioned earlier, when you move the workload forWindows Update Policiesto Intune, you areonlymoving the workload for Microsoft 1st-party updates. 3rd-party updates are normally built as Win32 apps, in Intune. In order to target updates to devices from Intune, as Win32 apps, you must set theClient Appsworkload to either Intune, or Pilot Intune. Another consideration when moving both theClient appsandWindows Update Policiesworkloads to Intune, is bandwidth. Bandwidth planning Carefully sizing a Configuration Manager hierarchy, planning placement of Distribution Points (including a Cloud Management Gateway, a Cloud Distribution/Management Point) and working with the network team to ensure adequate bandwidth is available to deliver content to clients, is critical. In the world of WSUS, you typically download the updates once from the Content Delivery Network (CDN) and distribute them across that carefully built hierarchy without bringing down your network. As you move the update workload to Windows Update leveraging WUfB/Intune, your Windows devices will now all be reaching out to the CDN individually. The same is true for delivering Win32 apps from Intune for 3rd-party updates. While this is super useful, your Windows devices will be pulling Win32 app content directly from Azure storage. Have you made suitable accommodation for the extra bandwidth those clients will use, sitting nicely within your WAN? You can be totally smart and well prepared for the move, but it requires careful planning. Technologies likeDelivery OptimizationandConnected Cachecertainly demand attention. The folks over at2Pinthave done a lot of work in this area. Optimal Delivery Optimization settings for Intune managed devices can be found atDelivery Optimization Recommendations for Microsoft Intune (2pintsoftware.com) A quick overview of the types of download content supported by delivery Optimization can be found atWhat is Delivery Optimization? \u2013 Windows Deployment | Microsoft Learn When you configure clients to use the Connected Cache server, they no longer request content from the internet. Instead, clients request the content from the cache server. The following content is supported for a Connected Cache server:- Microsoft Store apps (UWP) Windows feature and quality updates (WUfB only, not WSUS) Forco-management workloads:-Windows Update:Windows feature and quality updates (WUfB only, not WSUS)Office Click-to-Run apps:Microsoft 365 Apps and updatesClient apps:Microsoft Store apps/updates (UWP) and Win32 appsEndpoint Protection:Windows Defender definition updates Windows Update:Windows feature and quality updates (WUfB only, not WSUS) Office Click-to-Run apps:Microsoft 365 Apps and updates Client apps:Microsoft Store apps/updates (UWP) and Win32 apps Endpoint Protection:Windows Defender definition updates You can read more about the Microsoft Connected Cache server atMicrosoft Connected Cache \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn Note:While Connected Cache requires a Configuration Manager Distribution Point \u2018today\u2019, we hope to see Microsoft release a standalone Connected Cache feature very soon. A standalone Connected Cache server will be pretty awesome for folks who have moved all their management eggs to Intune but still have a significant number of devices behind the same NAT\u2019d WAN connection. Read more atMicrosoft Connected Cache overview \u2013 Windows Deployment | Microsoft Learn Dual Scan \u2013 going deeper When Windows devices have their Windows Update workload set to Configuration Manager, the registry valueHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdateDisableDualScanDWORD is set to0. This means ALL updates come from WSUS. When the workload is moved to either Intune or Pilot Intune, theDisableDualScanvalue changes to0. We can observe the impact Dual Scan has when the Windows Update Agent performs a scan on a Windows 10 device. The WindowsUpdate.log indicates that, in this instance, the Update Orchestrator initiated the Windows Update scan using the service URLhttps://fe2cr.update.microsoft.com/v6/. The log snippet below has been shortened for simplicity but after Windows Update has been contacted and updates evaluated, the service URL is then changed to the local WSUS serverhttps://bb-cm1.byteben.com:8531/ClientWebService/client.asmxand it is indicated that Windows content for WUfB is blocked. Note:To generate the WindowsUpdate.log on the desktop, run the PowerShell cmdletGet-WindowsUpdateLog The above test was performed with Configuration Manger 2309 and Windows 10 22H2 We know thatWindows 11 does not support Dual Scan, but when the Windows Update policies workload is moved to Intune for a Windows 11 device,DisableDualScanis still set to 0 in the registry. For prosperity reasons perhaps (shrugs). Scan Source The elephant in the room. There has been some confusion over the part Dual Scan still plays given that the setting is now deprecated. Dual Scanis notsupported on Windows 11. On Windows 10 it is replaced by the new WindowsScan Source Policyand is not recommended for use on version 2004 or greater. That being said, Dual Scan is still configured by the Configuration Manager client when co-management is in the picture, irrelevant of the Windows version. This is most probably an intentional decision by Microsoft, given some organizations are still supporting older versions of Windows 10. When the Windows Update workload is moved to Intune for a Windows 11 device, we can/should see the following policies configured in the registry. SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForDriverUpdates Configure this policy to specify whether to receive Windows Driver updates from Windows Update endpoint, managed by Windows Update for Business policies, or through your configured WSUS server. 1 = (Default) Detect, download and deploy Driver Updates from WSUS.0 = Detect, download and deploy Driver Updates from Windows Update. SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForFeatureUpdates Configure this policy to specify whether to receive Windows feature updates from Windows Update endpoint, managed by Windows Update for Business policies, or through your configured WSUS server. 1 = (Default) Detect, download and deploy Feature Updates from WSUS.0 = Detect, download and deploy Feature Updates from Windows Update SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForOtherUpdates This policy controls the source for other Microsoft updates, available from the Windows Update service, that are not part of the default Operating System. Updates in the MSI format are normally in scope for this workload. Read more athttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb#types-of-updates-managed-by-windows-update-for-business. Important:This policy is often misunderstood. It does not control or dictate the source for 3rd-party updates, which will always scan against WSUS if a Windows Update Server is specified in the registry. Configure this policy to specify whether to receive Other Updates from Windows Update endpoint, managed by Windows Update for Business policies, or through your configured WSUS server. UseUpdateClassPolicySource For the scan source policies to take effect, theUseUpdateClassPolicySourcevalue specified at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AU must be enabled and set to 1. Windows 11 Let take a look at how Scan Source is configured for co-managed Windows 11 devices when we spun up the lab. The following tests were performed with Configuration Manger 2309 and Windows 11 23H2. If youhave notconfigured a Windows 11 device for co-management but Software Updates are configured in the Client Settings, the expectation is for all Scan Source Policies to be set1(intent for all Microsoft updates to come from WSUS) and the UseUpdateClassPolicySourceshouldbe enabled (set to 1). The image above also shows that the Configuration Manager Client has set local policy to achieve the desired configuration state. Again. If youhaveconfigured a Windows 11 device for co-management, buthave notmoved the Windows Update Policies workload to Intune, the expectation is for all Scan Source Policies to be set1(intent for all Microsoft updates to come from WSUS). It is also expected that the UseUpdateClassPolicySourceshouldbe enabled (set to 1). At the time of writing this blog, many people are reporting inconsistencies with Scan Source policies where both Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices are reaching out to the Windows Update service. This is occurring even though all indications are that the device is configured to only talk to WSUS i.e. the workload has not been moved to Intune. If youhaveconfigured a Windows 11 device for co-management and youhavemoved the Windows Update policies workload to Intune, the expectation is for all Scan Source policies to be set0(intent for all Microsoft updates to come from the Windows Update service). It is also expected, or so we thought, that the UseUpdateClassPolicySourceshouldbe enabled (set to 1) too. That theory sounds pretty sound right? Well, Scan Source is actually explicitly disabled using a local policy set by the Configuration Manager client. This confused us a little\u2026well, a lot actually. When Scan Source is not configured, theMicrosoft docsindicate that all Windows Updates, for Windows 11 devices, will still come from WSUS. If Configuration Manager is disabling Scan Source, should we interpret that as Scan Source policy as not configured? What\u2019s interesting here is that even though Scan Source policies are disabled by Configuration Manager client policy, the Windows Update agent is still talking to both WSUSandother internet services too. We can see this from the log snippet below where ProtocolTalker switches between different ServiceIds. If we zoom in on the detail a little, we can see the device communicating with the DCAT Prod Flighting service. During the scan we see driver updates are evaluated. We then see a switch to WSUS but all Microsoft Update categories are filtered, indicating only 3rd-party updates will be scanned only in WSUS. Confused? Come join us by the camp fire of fun. Even though the Configuration Manager client is disabling Scan Soure\u2026.it appears to be working as expected when the workload is move to Intune. Confirmed bug 1 \u2013 Scan Source is \u201cwonky\u201d Microsoft has acknowledged that Scan Source is not being configured correctly, \u201cthere are a few wonky things\u201d. We have made some assumptions on how we think it should work above but we will reserve judgement until we see an update or bug fix. Thank you Aria for giving us some hope this will be resolved. https://x.com/ariaupdated/status/1741970744773329037?s=20 As mentioned earlier, some folks in the community are also seeing devices, when the workload is with Configuration Manager, still reaching out to Windows Update for updates. Come join the conversation athttps://x.com/PaulEAndrews/status/1741869611346432472?s=20 Bryan Dam also came across the \u201cScan Source Saga\u201d and shared some good thoughts and workarounds in his blog. Check it out atWindows 11 Fails to Detect Updates After July\u2019s Cumulative Update \u2013 Patch Tuesday Blog Confirmed bug 2 \u2013 KB25073607 The Configuration Manager Clientshouldbe setting UseUpdateClassPolicySource when the Windows Update policies workload is moved to Intune. That is what this KB states, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly say what it should be setting it to. Again, our assumption is that the UseUpdateClassPolicySource policy should be enabled (set to 1). Many customers have found that their Windows 11 22H2 devices were not honouring the configured Scan Source policies. This \u201cshould\u201d be fixed in Configuration Manager 2309 and later. A hotfix was release in October 2023 for Configuration Manager version 2303. This revised update uses KB article ID 25506239, Client update for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2303 \u2013 Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn At the time of writing this post, it is not understood if this fixshouldhave fixed the UseUpdateClassPolicySource issue for all Windows 11 versions or just version 22H2. Conclusion Co-management is a great concept. It kinda feels like some things were looked over when the switch to Scan Source was made in Windows 11 from Dual Scan. Perhaps that\u2019s just an unfair misinterpretation on my part due to a lack of documentation or explanation of the hand-over from Dual Scan to Scan Source. The road got bumpy real quick. The frustration comes from feedback \u2013 it simply isn\u2019t acceptable in large organizations for devices to reach out and get updates that admins hadn\u2019t planned for. These kinds of things crush confidence and do not lend well to admins wanting to move quickly to Intune. I always ask and seek the answer to the question, \u201cHow does it work and how should it be configured?\u201d If documentation was clear and detailed for new features and technology transitions, when somethings goes wrong, we can plan for and initiate a \u201cPlan B\u201d. We can\u2019t invoke our \u201cPlan B\u201d if we have to fight through smoke and mirrors to guess what \u201cPlan B\u201d might look like. Things should improve Rumours are that Scan Source is actively being addressed. Some admins have shared that the December 2023 CU seemed to \u201cimprove\u201d the condition where devices were reaching out to Windows Update unintentionally. We will continue our testing and update this post accordingly. Scan Source is a big part of why we are here today. We bow our heads to Dual Scan who served us well in her time. Pushing out your 3rd-party updates from WSUS is still solid, in our testing of Scan Source, it behaved well and as expected (always coming from WSUS). Update 18th September 2024 \u2013 New WUAHandler.dll saves the day? (not quite) Microsoft releasedKB28458746for ConfigMgr 2403 which we thought would address many of the Windows Update issues users were experiencing. Effectively, Microsoft will now stop configuring ScanSource Policies which appeared to be affecting the Windows Update Agents ability to switch between different Windows Update sources on some co-managed devices. The KB doesn\u2019t specifically call this issue out, most of the detail and focus is around fixing an issue where Feature On Demand tools, like .NET 3.5 and other optional features would not download for co-managed devices because of the ScanSource Policy configuration the ConfigMgr client was enforcing. The files updated by this KB on the client are shown below. In the payload of this recent KB, we noticed that WUAHandler.dll was modified. If you inspect previous versions of WUAHandler.dll you can see that it is configured to set the \u201cPolicyDrivenUpdateSource\u201d policies. The hotfix version of WUAHandler.dll nowonlyenables ScanSource by setting \u201cUseUpdateClassPolicySource\u201d, it does not configure any of the \u201cPolicyDrivenUpdateSource\u201d policies like it did previously (DualScan policy is still being enforced too just for the record). After clients were patched with this KB, Client Version 5.00.9128.1014, we confirmed that value was being set as expected. The only issue is, the KB did not \u201cundo\u201d the previous ScanSource Policies that ConfigMgr had configured. You may see undesirable ScanSource values still on clients \u2013 that local policy will live on forever in the devices in \u201cC:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\Registry.pol\u201d until a higher source policy overrides it. This may not be a show stopper. Those local policy values for \u201cPolicyDrivenUpdateSource\u201d might be correct on your co-managed devices, but if they are not then applying this KB may result in the Windows Update Agent now scanning against a source you had not planned on. When the Windows Update workload for co-managed devices is shifted to WUfB, ConfigMgr was setting the \u201cPolicyDrivenUpdateSource\u201d values to 0 \u2013 indicating all first-party updates should come from Windows Update. If the Windows Update workload was not moved, the value was being set to 1 \u2013 indicating all first-party workloads would come from WSUS. After applying this new KB, Microsoft recommends that admins use a GPO (or Intune Settings catalog policy) to set ScanSource Policies to what they would like them to be. As GPO/Intune Policy is a more authoritive policy source, they will override the previous values the ConfigMgr client had set. We are good then right? It gets even messier, honestly. We removed Registry.pol and forced a GPUpdate on a test device and that removed those old ScanSource policies\u2026.but then we witnessed ConfigMgr went ahead and started applying them again\u2026this was completely not expected. We are still trying to understand what is happening here. Again, this policy will be overwritten with YOUR desired settings if you set the GPO or Intune Settings catalog policy to configure Scan Source polices. What does this mean Ben? Well, we are still testing different scenarios in the lab, but the new fix does not appear to fix much. ConfigMgr is now backing away (for the most part) from configuring ScanSource and leaving it up to admins to fix with their own policies. A friend of ours in the community, Daniel, came across some more, undocumented, Windows Update Cache registry keys. These were also affecting which update source the Windows Update Agent reached out to for updates. Daniel and his team had to remove those keys before the Windows Update agent would start doing \u201cas it was told\u201d. HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\UpdatePolicy\\GPCache\\CacheSet001\\WindowsUpdate\\* HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\UpdatePolicy\\GPCache\\CacheSet002\\WindowsUpdate\\* We then saw another user in the community in aRedditpost claim that further, undocumented, policy needed to be removed on their devices:- HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Servicing -Name LocalSourcePath HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Servicing -Name RepairContentServerSource Where does that leave us? Honestly, head scratching still. We have half a dozen cases where customers have reached out claiming the Windows Update Agent is not behaving as expected. We are still looking into this pandora black box of magic but nothing conclusive has revealed itself \u2013 yet. We will keep digging, but at the moment I\u2019m left thinking the following approach\u201cmight\u201dbe worth considering, but I would strongly encourage full testing. 1. Create a GPO or set this policy from the settings catalog in Intune If you have moved the Windows Update workload to WUfB:- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForDriverUpdates -Value 0 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForFeatureUpdates -Value 0 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForOtherUpdates -Value 0 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForQualityUpdates -Value 0 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AU -Name UseUpdateClassPolicySource -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD If you still want all updates to come from WSUS:- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForDriverUpdates -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForFeatureUpdates -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForOtherUpdates -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate -Name SetPolicyDrivenUpdateSourceForQualityUpdates -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AU -Name UseUpdateClassPolicySource -Value 1 -Type REG_DWORD 2. Rename Registry.Pol to remove old ConfigMgr local policy Renaming the following file should have no adverse effect, it is where local machine policy is read from and then applied. It will be rebuilt when machine policy is next updated (GPUpdate /Force). \u201cC:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\Registry.pol\u201d to \u201cC:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\Registry.old\u201d 3. Delete the undocumented GPCache Keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\UpdatePolicy\\GPCache\\CacheSet001\\WindowsUpdate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\UpdatePolicy\\GPCache\\CacheSet002\\WindowsUpdate 4. Remove Windows Servicing Policy (if exists) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\PoliciesServicing -Name RepairContentServerSource HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Servicing -Name LocalSourcePath 5. Restart WUAgent In summary, we are still as baffled as our customers and community colleagues on why update servicing is so temperamental for co-managed devices. We continue to move forwards into the abyss of the unknown, trying to shed light on the battle that rages between ConfigMgr and the Windows Update workload. What we can say with certainty\u2026moving the co-management workload slider for Windows Updates is not the \u201cone-click\u201d solution like it used to be in the simple days of Windows 10 and DualScan. Things to remember Remember, moving the Windows Update policies workload to Intune only affects Microsoft 1st-party updates. If you want to deploy Win32 apps from Intune, simply move over theClient Appsworkload. The Client Apps workload, unlike the others, is not a \u201cthis or that\u201d switch. It simply allows Win32 apps to be processed by the Intune Management Extension. You can still target applications from Configuration Manager, too. Finally If you want to fly to the cloud, un-hindered by Configuration Manager and the complexities of Scan Source, simply deploy a Client Setting with the Software Updates component disabled. From that point, you are cloud only for Windows Updates. Ensure you are prepared for this, thepre-requisitesare met for WUfB, and your devices are registered with the Windows Update service.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/write-better-powershell-you-re/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Write Better PowerShell \u2013 You\u2019re Out of Excuses PowerShell has, for many admins, become an indispensable tool. Its versatility, and, dare I say, \u201cpower\u201d, have made it a go-to tool for a wide range of tasks around Windows management. Over the course of the past year, PowerShell\u2019s adoption has continued to increase. With the arrival of advanced tools like GitHub CoPilot, Chat GPT, and more, there are dozens of new ways to optimize the writing of a PowerShell script. Let\u2019s take a look at the common ways we can use these new tools to improve our everyday PowerShell scripts, and, because nothing is perfect, some security concerns we should have as a result of these emerging technologies. GitHub Copilot GitHub CoPilot is one of many tools you can use to help streamline some of the repetitive tasks found in writing and documenting PowerShell scripts. While GitHub does have a monthly cost attached, if you find yourself writing PowerShell scripts regularly, then it really is worth the small fee. If you want to learn more about how to acquire and configure GitHub CoPilot, you can read morehere. Assuming you\u2019ve moved away from the PowerShell ISE and use a more standard IDE like VSCode, you should be pretty familiar with the process of adding an extension. Once you\u2019ve added the CoPilot extension, you can ask it for help anywhere in your code using the hotkey \u201cctrl+I\u201d. But don\u2019t worry: if you forget these things easily, CoPilot will be there to remind you of the rules. So that\u2019s great, but what are some practical uses for it? Commenting Scripts So You Don\u2019t Have To One of the more onerous tasks in writing PowerShell scripts is maintaining accurate comments. Fortunately, with the introduction of GitHub CoPilot, your life just got a lot easier. As an example, watch how I take one of my favorite useless PowerShell functions and have the code commented for easier readability: So that\u2019s all well and good, but it\u2019s still a pretty useless PowerShell function. Can it do something more complicated? Of course! Here\u2019s an example: Learning About New Code That\u2019s not all, though. If you\u2019re new to Windows PowerShell, GitHub CoPilot can also help you understand what the code you\u2019ve downloaded actually does. Let\u2019s take a look at something I found on the Patch My PCcommunity GitHub: Here, you can see that after copying the code into VSCode, I selected a few lines and asked CoPilot to explain; the result was a brief synopsis that tells me exactly what that code does. This can help me gain confidence when parsing out functions or scripts I stumble upon online, especially if it\u2019s in a scripting language I\u2019m unfamiliar with. Writing Boring Code If you\u2019ve already mastered the entire PowerShell language, you may be thinking, \u201cwhere is the value in this for me?\u201d. Well, if you value time-and I\u2019m betting you do since you probably automate administrative tasks for a living-fear not! CoPilot can help by saving your fingers from writing repetitive code (e.g., hash tables). That\u2019s neat code, right? But does it work? Looks good to me! How About Unit Tests? The more complicated your custom PowerShell commands get, the more likely you are to introduce a concept called unit tests. However, writing unit tests is, to put it lightly, a time-consuming and confusing process. It\u2019s so difficult that most people only familiar with the PowerShell ISE are not comfortable with it. Don\u2019t worry, though: if you\u2019re one of those people, CoPilot can help with this too. You can quickly test this by using CTRL+I to start the prompt (as discussed above), then simply ask it to write a unit test for you! If you already have the Pester PowerShell module installed, you can select the three dots in the top right corner of the code snippet to insert the code into a \u201cnew file\u201d. From there, you can save it with the appropriate file name. For my purposes, my \u201cappropriate file name\u201d is \u201cget-dadjoke.tests.ps1\u201d. I can then run the call invoke-pester from the directory with both files, and presto! I now have unit tests. Cool, But What About ChatGPT? AI and ChatGPT have been revolutionizing how we use and learn programming languages. If you were to ask me, \u201cwhat do I need to know about PowerShell?\u201d, I would tell you there are only three things you need to memorize. Get-Help Get-Help Get-Command Get-Command Get-Member Get-Member If you memorize these three PowerShell cmdlets, you can eventually teach yourself to fish. But that\u2019s just me, a mere human. What does ChatGPT think about this? If I input the prompt \u201cGive me a common set of PowerShell Cmdlets everyone should know\u201d into ChatGPT, I get this: Turns out, the robots agree with me on the most important PowerShell cmdlets you can learn. Who would have thought? So\u2026 Can ChatGPT Just Do It for Me, Then? Well, if we give it the same prompt as we did in GitHub CoPilot, it might give us a good answer along with some more context. However, because ChatGPT\u2019s nature is language and context focused first, it may take some liberties you aren\u2019t expecting. However, these new innovations don\u2019t come without a cost. While the internet enabled us to all connect to each other, it turns out not all of us have the best intentions in mind. Just as you might use this tool to simplify your coding life, tools like this will be used by threat actors to develop better PowerShell scripts faster as well. So, what should you be aware of, that way you don\u2019t accidentally run malicious code in your environment? Before Running PowerShell Scripts When you\u2019re getting ready to run a PowerShell script you didn\u2019t create, there are several things to keep in mind. Here\u2019s a list of things I commonly look for below: Community ReputationWas the code written by someone I know?Are lots of people already using the code?

Does the code utilize remote commands or encoded commands? PowerShell Trust Trust is a powerful word in the world of scripting. It takes time and continuous work to build in our industry. However, anyone can upload code toGitHubor thePowerShell Gallery. So, what are indicators of a trustworthy piece of code? One of the first \u201cat a glance\u201d indicators of how good or trusted a PowerShell script might be is often based on metrics. Take, for example, the commonly usedPowerShell Application Deployment Toolkitor PSADT. If you look at the code repository on GitHub, you\u2019ll quickly see the tool is incredibly popular. PowerShell Code Signing PowerShell is shipped as a part of the Windows operating system, and, if configured as such, it allows administrators to execute remote commands. It\u2019s also frequently seen as a part of an attacker\u2019s toolkit. What\u2019s less common, though, is for attackers to sign their code using publicly trusted certificates, as these certificates are difficult to acquire and maintain. By default, Microsoft sets the default execution policy to be restricted on Windows computers. This commonly leads system administrators, when they first launch PowerShell, to run: This allows a system to bypass its execution policy for all PowerShell scripts run on the machine. While this might be a great way to test code, it may not be the best default to run with. Due to the nature of how challenging and expensive it is to acquire a code signing certificate, most public authors do not sign their code. Unfortunately, this process will only get more difficult with recent standard changes for public certificate authorities around hardware security modules (HSM). However, some authors do use these certificates, as it ensures their provided PowerShell script has not been modified by others. If you\u2019re unsure what a signed PowerShell script looks like, look at the bottom of a script file for something that looks like this: If you see this with a large string of text below it, that is a good indicator the code was signed. That being said, a signature does not mean you should trust the code by default. To truly trust the PowerShell script, you should investigate the certificate it was signed with, who issued the certificate, and validate you trust the author and signer of the code. Otherwise, you could end up in a situation like this: Okay, So What About AI? You may be wondering if you can use AI to determine if written code is secure. As an example, I tried it with a PowerShell module I wrote several years ago calledCMOperations. This is something that uses PowerShell remoting to call Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) actions on a remote Configuration Manager client. Unfortunately, the results weren\u2019t terribly helpful. Out of curiosity, I tried this again with different programming languages (specifically, Java and GO). I found that when I used some Java from a repository that is purposefully used as a showcase insecure code, I got a very different result. When I tested against a GO package, I wrote code for downloading a CSV file in a simple tool I use regularly. I was promptly yelled at for not validating my outputs. End result? The security validation is still hit or miss and very contextual. Now I\u2019m Scared\u2026 Will The Robots Really Replace Me? If you\u2019ve already learned how to use PowerShell, I think you\u2019re safe. If anything, I hope this post has inspired you to dust off some of those old PowerShell scripts and run them through the various AI tools out there so you can share them with the community. All of this being said, if you\u2019re still using the command prompt, don\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll be fine. But with all of these tools at your disposal, you should have an easier time making the migration from the command line to the PowerShell console, especially when you can just ask for a simple reference sheet when you\u2019re lost.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-8018000a-beyondtrust-wwahost-error/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The 8018000a That Should Not Be There This blog will discuss a strange Windows Autopilot failure that appeared on newly installed Windows 11 24H2 devices that had been updated with the July update. Even after a clean install and update, the device threw a8018000aenrollment error. What followed was a deeper investigation into why the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) failed and how a third-party component fromBeyondTrust EPMhad silently caused the issue. Introduction The July Windows 11 24H2 build is now available, and most companies have already begun updating their Windows images or deployment pipelines to support it. In many environments, devices are fully upgraded to the latest version of 24H2 before any Autopilot enrollment begins. Some use OSDCloud to apply the latest build. Others manually upgrade or integrate the upgrade through their existing provisioning workflows. Either way, the goal is the same: start Autopilot from a clean, up-to-date base. (Until Microsoft finally releases theWindows Quality Update during OOBE, we need to do it manually.) So, when someone approached me about a strange Autopilot failure on a freshly upgraded device, I was interested. The setup was standard. The device had been wiped, reimaged, upgraded to 24H2, and then handed over to Autopilot. Yet during the flow, it failed in a way that made no immediate sense. The error was8018000a, the one that usually means \u201cthis device is already enrolled.\u201d So that explanation did not make sense at first. The device had just been installed and upgraded. It wasn\u2019t registered in Intune or Entra ID, and there were no signs of any previous MDM/Intune activity. Still, Windows was acting as if the device had already been enrolled. The Symptom: 8018000a The Autopilot enrollment kicked off as usual. The device reached the Enrollment Status Page and started pulling policies. But then something went really wrong. Without any clear warning, the device dropped out of the ESP flow and returned to the initial OOBE screen. When the user attempted to continue, Autopilot attempted to start again, and it was at this point that the8018000aerror appeared. The message was clear: \u201cThis device is already enrolled.\u201d It felt like we were dealing with some leftovers or a reused system. However, it was a brand-new, clean build. So where did that enrollment state come from? Why That 8018000a Error Usually Makes Sense In most cases, this type of error occurs when enrollment registry keys are still present on the machine. For example, if the device was previously enrolled into Intune and was not fully reset, some artifacts may remain. These could include registry keys under the MDM enrollment path or the Intune MDM device certificate stored in the system certificate store. When that happens, the fix is well known. You can remove the following: Registry keys under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments The corresponding enterprise-mgt Scheduled tasks. The Microsoft Intune MDM certificate from the LocalMachine store TheCall4Cloudscript covers exactly that scenario. Delete the leftover registry keys and tasks, reboot the system, and Autopilot enrollment typically proceeds without any issues. But in this case, that explanation did not hold up. The device was 100% clean. It had just been upgraded to 24H2 (with the July build) and had not been enrolled before. So the presence of the enrollment keys and certificate was unexpected. Zooming Out: What Actually Happened Looking at the bigger picture, here is what likely happened. Windows Autopilot kicked off as usual. The Enrollment Status Page loaded. Then something crashed during the process. Instead of completing or showing an error, the system quietly returned to the beginning of OOBE. The user assumed they could just log in again and resume the flow. However, by that time, the MDM enrollment had already been successful behind the scenes. The device had received its Intune MDM certificate, and the registry already contained the enrollment information. So when the Autopilot process restarted, it tried to perform MDM enrollment again. That triggered a conflict. The device was already enrolled, at least as far as the system was concerned, so Windows blocked the second attempt. And it did so with error8018000a. What the Logs Revealed To determine the actual cause of the failure, we examined the Application event log more closely. It was then that the issue became 100% clear and obvious. The Application Event log showed a crash in wwahost.exe, the host process for modern UWP apps. The faulting module was PGHook.dll, which comes from BeyondTrust Endpoint Privilege Management, previously known as Avecto Privilege Guard. That was the missing piece. Why This Completely Breaks Autopilot with error: 8018000a During Autopilot, the OOBE experience and the Enrollment Status Page are both powered by CloudExperienceHost. This component is implemented as a UWP app, which means it runs inside wwahost.exe. If PGHook.dll injects into that process and causes it to crash, the entire Windows Autopilot experience breaks without warning. With it, the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) disappears and the user is sent back to the beginning of OOBE. But because enrollment already occurred before the crash, the system cannot proceed a second time. There is no fallback, no recovery. The user just hits the8018000awall. What is a Hook Exclusion? BeyondTrust Endpoint Privilege Management uses a hooking mechanism to monitor and control how applications run. This involves injecting a DLL (PGHook.dll) into processes likewwahost.exeto intercept API calls and apply policy. A hook exclusion tells the EPM client to still inject the hook, but keep it dormant. The process is left untouched and allowed to run normally. This is useful when certain applications or system components become unstable due to that injection. In this case, excludingwwahost.exeensures that the CloudExperienceHost running inside it is not affected during Autopilot. That prevents the Enrollment Status Page from crashing. The 8018000a Fix for Now The only known workaround at this point is to preventPGHook from injecting into wwahost.exeduring Autopilot. Option 1: Manual registry exclusion (testing only) This can be done by manually creating the following registry values on the device: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Avecto\\Privilege Guard Client] \u201cHookExclusions\u201d=multi-string: wwahost.exe [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Avecto\\Privilege Guard Client] \u201cHookExclusions\u201d=multi-string: wwahost.exe When you don\u2019t want to do this manually, you can also export this registry key on a working device and upload it toRegistry to PowerShell converter. Which will give you a nice PowerShell script which you can upload to Intune. (PowerShell scripts are executed before Apps. With it, the registry key to exclude wwahost.exe is already present on the device the moment the BeyondTrust agent gets installed. Option 2: Policy-based exclusion via ManagedHookExclusions to prevent 8018000a In a production environment, use the Advanced Agent Settings section of your BeyondTrust policy to deploy the exclusion consistently. Add an entry for: Name: ManagedHookExclusions Value: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wwahost.exe Make sure this setting applies to both 32-bit and 64-bit configurations. Microsoft / BeyondTrust Their Response. It appears that BeyondTrust is indeed aware of this issue, but the latest update released this morning didn\u2019t resolve it. It\u2019s obvious that we also passed our findings to the Microsoft team responsible for Enrollment. So we need to have a bit of patience. Final Thoughts If you are using (Avecto) BeyondTrust Endpoint Privilege Management and you are seeing unexpected Autopilot or ESP failures on Windows 11 24H2, it is worth checking for PGHook activity. A crash in wwahost.exe during Autopilot is not random. It disrupts the ESP flow, leaves the device in a partially enrolled state, and ensures that the next login attempt fails with error code8018000a. Until Microsoft or BeyondTrust provides an update to address this behavior, excluding wwahost.exe from hook injection is currently the only effective workaround. If you are preparing your environment for 24H2, keep this in mind, especially if you rely on Privilege Guard or similar tools that inject into core system processes.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/patch-my-pc-advanced-insights/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Patch My PC Advanced Insights In the years that you have had Microsoft Configuration Manager deployed in your environment, it has built up a vast database of compliance and inventory across a wide range of your devices. This data is useful to technical and management teams, but is often only accessible to Configuration Manager administrators, mostly because the interfaces to the data are complex and unwieldy. A second frustration with the Configuration Manager dataset is that the inventory profile hasn\u2019t kept pace with the features of the modern operating system, so we are missing out on reporting on features such as battery health, disk health, monitor configuration, and many more classes. Finally, there are external data sources available, which can greatly enhance the data held in Configuration Manager building on security, warranty, and support information to further leverage the dataset we have constructed. Patch My PC Advanced Insights addresses each of these areas and makes this data available across platforms, requiring only a web browser, no need to have the ConfigMgr Console installed, and is accessible on desktops, mobile, and tablets. The interface performs greatly better than the native SQL Reporting Services solution and provides a more fluid experience for the user. Our approach to making the data in Configuration Manager more useful and accessible in your organization uses modern web technologies to provide an attractive, intuitive, and accessible portal to all ConfigMgr disciplines. We build high-level dashboard views of data such as software update compliance to provide at-a-glance information about the entire update landscape with all components of the dashboard being clickable to drill through for more data. The dashboards are actionable, with the integration of ConfigMgr console actions, remote control, and collection modifications available in the portal. And we build on the native ConfigMgr dataset with our custom Patch My PC WMI Provider to enhance inventory and compliance. Useful OS properties including battery and SSD health, user-based applications, monitor configuration, certificate status, user rights, and more, make Advanced Insights the optimal interface for Configuration Manager. Finally, we enhance the Configuration Manager dataset through integration with APIs from Microsoft Security Research Center, NIST, Dell, Lenovo, and several APIs we have developed in-house to provide support and security data constructed on the native dataset. Let\u2019s look at each of these areas in a bit more detail. Data Presentation and Useability Here is a quick scenario where Configuration Manager native data presentation makes the admin\u2019s job more difficult. I want a report of all laptops with 8GB RAM or less. In Configuration Manager, there\u2019s no in-built concept of a laptop, so the first thing I might do is create a Collection of All Laptops, I need to use the \u201cChassis Types\u201d property with a query that includes something like this: ChassisTypes 8, 9, 10, and 14 are Portable, Laptop, Notebook, and Sub Notebook, respectively. I can then use this Collection to filter my reports. Or so you\u2019d think\u2026 In the Reports node of the ConfigMgr console the Hardware \u2013 Memory folder contains five reports, The \u201cComputers with low memory (less than or equal to specified MB)\u201d report looks like a good candidate for my requirement. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no collection filter here. Once exported I could exclude servers easily using the Operating System Name, but I\u2019ve got no way of separating laptops and desktops. The report also does nothing to help me identify the user or model of the devices. Advanced Insights will present us with a more graphical, intuitive route to this data via the Resources dashboard. We can filter the charts on this page by collection, pivot the charts to show memory, manufacturer, disk space, etc., and export the filtered dataset, which includes all of the properties I need to identify the user, make, model, and configuration of a laptop client. Presenting the Configuration Manager data in this way is one example of how making the data more accessible enables better and wider use of the data in your organization. Extended Inventory Configuration Manager has not kept up to date with some useful properties from the modern operating system. Advanced Insights custom WMI Provider adds new properties to the inventory schema and then presents the data generated alongside the default properties from Configuration Manager. The Advanced Insights property schema is growing all the time and currently includes: Battery Health Battery Health Disk Health Disk Health Monitor Configuration Monitor Configuration User Installed Applications User Installed Applications Update compliance for Microsoft Update Update compliance for Microsoft Update Driver details from Microsoft Update Driver details from Microsoft Update We\u2019ll look at the monitor data as that is a great example of where Advanced Insights adds value to the ConfigMgr dataset, presenting a useful interface for the support team. Configuration Manager knows little natively about the user\u2019s display devices. It has some video card information and it knows some basic information about monitors. If a user needs a monitor or cable replaced or is just having difficulties with screen configuration, it is useful to be able to see what they are seeing. Advanced Insights will provide this view. The Displays dashboard shows me all devices and their connected displays, the details of model, manufacturer, and connectivity, and the physical layout of the devices as viewed from the user\u2019s perspective. Enhanced Data We can build on the data held in Configuration Manager through integration with external APIs. These provide us with support, warranty, and security information. For example, the Advanced Insights Threat Analytics page takes required update information for the Microsoft and Patch My PC Catalogs and then presents that data combined with CVE information from the Microsoft Security Research Center, NIST, and RedHat security APIs. This allows us to view the security posture of the environment from an updates perspective and rapidly ascertain where the biggest risks lie and how we should work to remediate them. Advanced Insights also enables us to act against vulnerable machines to invoke update deployment tasks, invoke a restart, etc. Summary Patch My PC Advanced Insights builds on your Configuration Manager investment to deliver an attractive, intuitive, responsive interface for support teams, managers, and analysts across your organization.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/ivanti-vs-patch-my-pc/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Ivanti vs. Patch My PC: Winning In Court, Not Just Customer\u2019s Hearts At Patch My PC, we prefer not to talk about our competitors a whole lot. Not because we fear comparisons but because we havevaluesthat we earnestly try to live by. It is no coincidence that our first value isWe are Humbleand the second isWe Avoid Shenanigans. We would rather focus on the excellent work our product team does than try and give you our biased opinions of a competitor\u2019s offering. Admittedly, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have customer after customer happy to do so:Patch My PC Customer Testimonials. That said, we recently concluded a very unpleasant interaction with Ivanti that we felt we should address, given that it is ofpublic recordand likely to be a prominent search result. In short,Ivanti sued us for alleged patent infringement, and we won. If you want more detail, read on, but the takeaway is that a lot of money and focus that could have been put into improving our product was spent on a frivolous lawsuit instead. So What Happened? On October 21, 2021, a business development representative from Ivanti reached out via multiple channels over several days to arrange a meeting with our founder, Justin Chalfant. Based on the communication, it appeared Ivanti wanted to chat about some type of partnership. We use Calendly to take meetings with external companies and our customers easily. However, this particular meeting was unusual in that within minutes, Ivanti\u2019s representative claimed that we violated their intellectual property and told us to expect an overnight FedEx delivery of apatent assertion letterthe next day. On the call, they proposed the following options: sell Patch My PC to Ivanti, pay Ivanti a per-device licensing fee, or prepare for legal action. Note: We are not lawyers. What follows is the admittedly our biased opinion. What Did Ivanti Claim? When we received the assertion letter the next day, it made claims regarding three patents:6,990,660,7,823,147, and8,407,687. What these patents outline, in general, is how a central server delivers update metadata and binaries to an agent and uses the information to decide if the update applies to that device. If that sounds like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or Configuration Manager (SCCM/ConfigMgr), then you wouldn\u2019t be far off, and in fact, their patent assertion letter (availablehere) was full of screenshots from Microsoft\u2019s documentation for WSUS and ConfigMgr. In essence, we were being sued because WSUS and ConfigMgr exist, and our products use their publicly documented APIs. It\u2019s worth noting that in our research, we could not find a public record of Ivanti litigating these patents against the company their assertion stated violated their patents: Microsoft. Instead, they have a record of litigating against smaller companies like Patch My PC andShavlik Technologies, which integrate with Microsoft\u2019s products. After several back-and-forth exchanges where we stated andsent comprehensive documentationthat none of our products did the things claimed in their patents, Ivanti ceased communicating. Hoping they had seen the light, we breathed a collective sigh of relief and began going about the rest of our lives. Hope, however, is a double-edged sword, and two months later, Ivanti filed a lawsuit in the federal courts of Colorado:DCO-1-22-cv-00643-1. A few weeks after filing,Ivanti offered to settle the case if we licensed their patents for $3 per unit. Given that our most expensive product SKU at the time was $3.50, we declined their offer. Dismissal Under U.S. Code \u00a7 101 The three patents in question are very old; by the end of the case, two had reached their twenty-year expiration. When Ivanti first approached us, two of the three patents had less than 1-year left. Several significant changes to the software patent landscape occurred during those two decades. The 2014 patent caseAlice Corp. v. CLS Bank Internationalis the most relevant. InAlice,the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201ccomputer system merely \u2018configured\u2019 to implement anabstract methodis no more patentable than an abstract method that is simply \u2018electronically\u2019 implemented.\u201d Essentially, you can\u2019t just take a pre-existing process, add \u2018but on a computer,\u2019 and patent that. Ivanti\u2019s patents cover the decision process of whether a computer needs a particular update. System administrators have performed this task since the dawn of software. Our legal team communicated to Ivanti that their patents were almost certainly invalid under Alice and that we would be filing a motion to dismiss based onU.S. Code \u00a7 101. We even sharedour motion to dismiss Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7. 101with Ivanti onMay 2, 2022, and we told them if they didn\u2019t drop the case, we would file the motion with the court. Ivanti respectfully disagreed with our position, so we filed the motion. Exactly 1-year later, untold riches, and many legal meetings later, the judge in the case (honorable Judge Nina Y. Wang) granted our motion to dismiss:2023 04 13 DI 047 Order On Motion to Dismiss. The money shot: This Court is persuaded that the first independent claim of each of the Patents-in-Suit is analogous to those cited by Defendant, and simply utilizes known components\u2014like the patch fingerprint\u2014in understood and conventional ways. Indeed, nothing in the claim language employs specific directions regarding programming or even instructions for what information the patch signature and/or the existence test is using or how it should be used, or how monitoring is accomplished. Instead, the Asserted Claims utilize generic statements regarding information gathering and exchange; use of such information within configurations; and monitoring the attempted download for an outcome. Plaintiff\u2019s conclusory arguments that the claims embody multiple inventive concepts are not supported by its citations to the claim language or the specificationThus, based on the record before it, this Court concludes that the Asserted Claims are invalid as claiming unpatentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Court will thusGRANTthe Motion to Dismiss..

In response, Ivanti filed a motion stating (again, we\u2019re not lawyers here): \u201cThe judge must be wrong because that sounds like we lost the case.\u201d As luck would have it, the judge was not swayed by this argument and denied their motion. Realizing they would lose, Ivanti offered to voluntarily dismiss the case and any possible appeal in exchange for us dropping our claim for lawyer fees. Happy to be finally done with this debacle, we agreed, and the case was officially dismissed. What Did This Mean For Patch My PC It meant a lot of time and money was wasted on a needless lawsuit. More importantly, it meant that our leadership had to focus on protecting our business instead of improving the company and, by extension, our customers. We are a small company, and we strive hard to maintain a laser-like focus on our customers. That\u2019s hard to do when a company, many times your size, decides to try to sue you. We held firm that we were in the right, persevered, and ultimately, the courts agreed. As a result: Ivantireceived no licensing fees from Patch My PC Ivanti\u2019s three patents asserted against Patch My PC were deemedinvalid by the courts Ivanti won\u2019t be able to assert these patents against other smaller companies in the patch management space We would havemuchpreferred that this whole debacle never happened, but this was the perfect outcome, given that it did. It is gratifying to know that justice prevailed in the end.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/proxy-misconfiguration-device-inventory-agent/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How a Proxy Misconfiguration Broke the Device Inventory Agent This blog covers a common but often missed misconfiguration: filtering or intercepting traffic todm.microsoft.com. One small mistake in how traffic was handled broke the linked enrollment process entirely, leaving behind hundreds of lingering broken enrollments and a missing Device Inventory Agent. Introduction \u2018Some issues leave behind a simple error message. Others leave you with 220 enrollments and the 220 corresponding keys in the registry, 170 scheduled tasks in the Enterprisemgt folder, and Device Inventory (Properties Catalog) andEPM agentsthat never show up. All because traffic todm.microsoft.com, a core MMP-C endpoint, was silently intercepted by a proxy. Without successful linked enrollment, theDevice Inventoryagent and theEndpoint Privilege Management agent never get installed, and there\u2019s no obvious error that the dual enrollment itself failed! We\u2019ll walk through how this happened, why it keeps happening, and why blocking dm.microsoft.com breaks far more than just one device or one Intune feature. Device Inventory depends on dm.microsoft.com To understand why blocking dm.microsoft.com causes problems, you first need to know what MMP-C is. Microsoft is moving away from the traditional sync-based policy model used by OMA DM. Instead, it\u2019s rolling out a new configuration framework called Declared Configuration (WinDC). This WinDC framework enforces the desired state continuously instead of waiting for the device to check in. To make this happen, Windows introduces a second enrollment called linked enrollment, in addition to the standard Intune MDM enrollment. This second channel is part of theMicrosoft Management Platform Cloud (MMP-C). It\u2019s how components like the Device Inventory Agent and Endpoint Privilege Management are delivered. And as more functionality moves into this model, the importance of linked enrollment keeps growing. For a solid technical deep dive, check out this explanation:From OMA DM to Declared Configuration When the Device Inventory Agent doesn\u2019t show Up Now that we\u2019ve covered some details about MMP-C, let\u2019s revisit how this issue manifested in this case. It started with a device that failed to populate any data in theResource Explorertab in Intune. All the configured properties showed no data. The Device Inventory Agent, which normally gets pulled in automatically, was also missing entirely. When looking closer at the properties catalog that should have triggered the Device Inventory agent to be installed, we noticed that they all got the error:2147749902 Other devices that didn\u2019t show the2147749902error, were stuck in a pending state The Linked Enrollment Key Reveals the Story With the properties catalog policy throwing weird errors we decided to look at the registry under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments. Why? As EPM and Device Inventory rely on aLinked Enrollmentand the first place to start troubleshooting the linked/dual enrollment is indeed the enrollment registry key. While doing so, the problem became immediately obvious. There were over 220 subkeys, each one a separate enrollment attempt. Each key represented a new attempt with its own GUID. Looking at the main Intune enrollment key in the registry, a subkey stood out: LinkedEnrollment. That subkey pointed directly at a discovery endpoint hosted at: https://discovery.dm.microsoft.com Somehow, it attempted to enroll in MMP-C, and it succeeded for 50%? From there on we opened the registry GUID that corresponded with theLinkedenrollmentIDfrom the picture above. Looking at theLinkedEnrollment and MMP-C Enrollment,we noticed several things. TheKeyContainernumber was unusually high. With every new enrollment, that number increases, so it was clear this device had gone through quite a few enrollments in the past. But there were also other signs that something was seriously going wrong. EnrollmentState = 4 Status = Failed to process server enrollment provisioning, rolling back This wasn\u2019t just a failed enrollment. It was a failed linked enrollment being retried endlessly, never succeeding, and leaving behind an old enrollment every time. EnterpriseMGT Scheduled Tasks: Bad Gateway 502 The fun extended into Task Scheduler. Under the scheduled task folder Microsoft\\WindowsEnterpriseMgmt, there were more than 170 subfolders. Each one matched an enrollment GUID from the registry. Inside, familiar task names kept showing up: Schedule #1, Schedule #2, and so on. Most hadn\u2019t run successfully. In the few cases where task history was available, the result was always the same: HTTP 502 Bad Gateway (0x801901F6) It was clear the system was trying to do something repeatedly and getting blocked with the bad gateway *502 error just before it could finish. *Error 502: status code indicates that a server was acting as a gateway orproxyand that it received an invalid response from the upstream server. If those scheduled tasks failed to be executed, one thing is for sure! The Device Inventory agent and its properties catalog policy you configured will never show up on the device! The Proxy That Broke the Linked Enrollment I guess the bad gateway 502 error made it all pretty clear that the devices seem to be running behind a proxy. After asking about it, he told me the devices were indeed behind an iBoss proxy. iBoss is a cloud-based web security and filtering solution commonly used in enterprise and education environments. It inspects outbound traffic and enforces policies using a combination of cloud gateways and on-device agents. The team believed their PAC file was configured to allow all Microsoft traffic, and at a glance, it seemed that way. But a closer look revealed a small typo in the PAC file, which only excluded *.cdm.microsoft.com. The critical *.dm.microsoft.com was missing. Because of that single oversight, any traffic to the MMP-C platform was either filtered, intercepted, or dropped. That meant the linked enrollment couldn\u2019t be completed successfully. Instead, it would fail, roll back, and try again endlessly. With the linked enrollment failing, the device inventory agent would never be installed. The Device Inventory Fix So, what happens when the proxy finally gets out of the way? To confirm the issue, theiBoss proxywas temporarily disabled on one of the affected devices. After kicking off the MMP-C sync (task scheduler), everything changed: The linked enrollment was finally completed The Device Inventory Agent was installed The logs reported a successful provisioning session Within 24 hours, the data showed up in the resource explorer All of it worked once traffic to dm.microsoft.com was no longer blocked. Why It Matters More Than You Think This issue wasn\u2019t just about Device Inventory. It was about how Intune is evolving. The same MMP-C enrollment ( Powered by WinDC Stack) is used for Endpoint Privilege Management. Eventually,Resource Access Policieswill also be moved over. That means if your proxy or SSL inspection still filters or blocksdm.microsoft.com, you\u2019re breaking parts of your device management and not just some new shiny Intune Features. Want to understand how Resource Access Policies are being re-routed through MMP C? Read this:MDM to MMP-C: Resource Access Policies. What You Should Do If you\u2019re using a proxy or a filtering solution, now\u2019s the time to double-check that you\u2019re explicitly allowing traffic to *.dm.microsoft.com. Even when the Official Microsoft documentation does NOT mention anything about this URL being required for Device Inventory to work, believe me, it is required! Ensure that you don\u2019t have SSL Inspection in place for DM.Microsoft.com, and please exclude that domain from going through your proxy! It will break EPM, Device Inventory, and future policy delivery to your devices! Conclusion MMP C is not an optional enhancement; it\u2019s a core part of Intune these days. Because Device Inventory is included in every Intune license, all managed Windows devices are now expected to have a linked enrollment. If communication to dm.microsoft.com is blocked, those devices won\u2019t raise red flags. They\u2019ll silently fail to complete the Linked Enrollment process. Check your PAC files, inspect your proxy settings, and make sure dm.microsoft.com is explicitly allowed. You don\u2019t want to end up with hundreds of failed linked enrollments.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/a-peek-inside-the-intune-management-extension-logs-new-appworkload-log-file-uncovered/", "title": "", "raw_text": "A Peek Inside the Intune Management Extension Logs: New Appworkload Log File Uncovered If you\u2019ve been wrestling with theIntune Management Extension (IME)lately, you know how essential those little log files are to your sanity. Whether you\u2019re deploying Win32 apps or troubleshooting a PowerShell script gone rogue, those logs are your trusty sidekicks. And guess what? Microsoft has added a couple of new ones to our arsenal\u2014say hello to AppWorkload.log and ClientCertCheck.log! Why the IME Logs Are Your Best Friends Let\u2019s face it\u2014troubleshooting without logs is like trying to find your way out of IKEA without those handy arrows on the floor. Every time something goes south with an application deployment, the first place we IT admins look is the log files. They tell us everything we need to know (and sometimes more) about what\u2019s happening under the hood. With the IME, these logs are like breadcrumbs leading us to the culprit. Over time, Microsoft has beefed up the logging capabilities in IME, giving us more granularity and more places to look when things go sideways. The New Kids on the Block: AppWorkload.log and ClientCertCheck.log When you thought you had all the logs under control, Microsoft introduced two more. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re all about: 1. IME AppWorkload.log This shiny new log is your go-to for tracking the workload of Win32 app deployments. If you\u2019re wondering how your apps are behaving, this log has got you covered. It dives into the nitty-gritty of app installations, checking off tasks like \u201cIs the app required?\u201d, \u201cDo we need to uninstall anything first?\u201d, and \u201cIs the app even applicable?\u201d. It\u2019s like the IME\u2019s personal assistant, making sure everything runs smoothly. In the past, these events were all logged inside the IntuneManagementExtension.log, but thankfully, Microsoft decided to move them over to this dedicated AppWorkload.log. Now, everything related to app deployments is neatly organized, making troubleshooting and monitoring a breeze. 2. IME ClientCertCheck.log Let\u2019s talk about the ClientCertCheck task in the Intune Management Extension\u2014it\u2019s like your device\u2019s security guard, constantly checking to ensure the client certificates used for device management are up to snuff. It dives into the LocalMachineMy store, ensuring each certificate has the right OID, a private key, and the correct subject name format. If all\u2019s good, it checks the tenant is eligible through a flighting check. This is all about keeping your device management secure and compliant, ensuring only valid certificates Where to Find These Logs Just like the other IME logs, these new additions are tucked away in the usual spot: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs Open the logs inOneTrace,CMTrace, or your log viewer of choice and start digging. They contain the information you need to keep your Intune App deployments running smoothly. Why These Logs Matter You might be thinking, \u201cGreat, more logs to check. Just what I needed!\u201d But trust me, these are here to make your life easier. The AppWorkload.log provides a more focused view on app deployments, which is super handy when you\u2019re managing a fleet of devices. And ClientCertCheck.log? Well, that\u2019s is something for an additional blog because when Microsoft decides to hardcode the flighted tenants in it, then it must be special? For now, I removed the complete tenant ID as I think it\u2019s weird that those are mentioned in the code. Keep an eye out for the additional blog focussing on this ClientCertCheck task! Wrapping Up So, next time you\u2019re neck-deep in troubleshooting an Intune issue, remember to check out these new logs. They might save you from hours of head-scratching. Separating these logs from the IntuneManagementExtension.log into their dedicated files is a game-changer, making your job as an IT admin much easier.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/win32-apps-stuck-portal/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Win32 Apps Stuck at 100% in the Company Portal Before We Dive In:This blog will focus on what could be the culprit when your Win32 apps get stuck at 100% installation when installing from the Company Portal. We\u2019ll walk you through the unusual symptoms we encountered, how you can trace the root cause, and why something as simple as a misconfigured PowerShell Execution Policy can completely derail your app deployments and Windows Autopilot enrollments. If you\u2019re experiencing issues with apps hanging during installation, this guide will help you pinpoint the problem and get your deployments back on track. Company Portal: Installing Win32 Apps It started with a simple observation: Win32 apps were getting stuck in the Company Portal. The apps would begin installing, show progress up to 100%, and then\u2026just sit there, stuck on installing for the rest of eternity. Hours would pass, and nothing would change, no errors, logs, or hints of what was going wrong. It was like the apps were trapped in some sort of installation purgatory. And then, to make things even stranger, Autopilot enrollments also began breaking. Devices would go through the standard enrollment phases, but once they hit the \u201cinstall required apps\u201d step, the whole process would grind to a halt. With the process being stuck, you will run into the Windows Autopilot issue:0x80070001 error. We were dealing with two separate but equally perplexing symptoms: apps that wouldn\u2019t start installing and Autopilot enrollments that couldn\u2019t be completed. There were no obvious clues, no visible errors, just a series of stalled processes. It was time to dig in and figure out what was happening. The Symptom: Win32 Apps stuck Installing. The first sign of trouble showed up in the Company Portal. Win32 apps were assigned for installation, but they never seemed to start. The Company Portal would display the app at 100% or get stuck at the \u201cInstalling\u201d stage indefinitely. Rebooting the device or restarting the Company Portal didn\u2019t help. It was as if Intune was sending out the command, but something silently blocked the process from the beginning. Around the same time, we noticed another peculiar behavior with Autopilot. Required apps, usually a mix of core software and configurations, would begin the initial preparation phase. But instead of completing and letting the device move to the next step, the enrollment would just hang. The device kept checking in with Intune as if it was waiting for something. But what? The Investigation: Uncovering Silent Failures We started digging into every possible log file, from Event Viewer entries to Intune Management Extension logs. We combed through the Windows Application logs, the DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics logs, and Intune Management Extension log. But nothing pointed us in the right direction. No errors, no failures, just a lot of repetitive status messages indicating that the app was still in a \u2018pending\u2019 state. To get a clearer picture of what was happening, we turned to theAppWorkload.logfile. This relatively new log file provides deeper insight into the app installation process and how the Intune Management Extension handles the Win32 app deployments. We saw that the app installer command was being generated, but no installation actions were being performed afterward. The service attempted to execute the PowerShell script, but there was no indication that it was starting or completing. As shown below, the Company Portal itself was constantly trying to fetch the status\u2026 It was as if the script had never been executed. There were no logs, errors, or feedback at all. Could it be that the scripts were failing without even getting a chance to run? If you want a more detailed look at what this log file reveals and how to interpret it, check out thisIntune Management Extension Deep Dive Webinarand an excellent breakdown of the new AppWorkload log structure in thisguide. Diving Deeper: Was Constrained Language Mode in Play? One of our initial hypotheses was that Constrained Language Mode might have been enforced. Constrained Language Mode is a feature that restricts certain PowerShell commands to mitigate security risks, but it can also interfere with custom detection scripts. To rule this out, we checked whether Constrained Language Mode was being applied to the system. If it had been, the PowerShell scripts used for detection could have been blocked or limited in functionality. You can find more details on how Constrained Language Mode impacts detection scripts in thisPatch My PC guide, which covers how to detect and disable the mode if necessary. But after confirming that Constrained Language Mode wasn\u2019t enabled, we knew we needed to look elsewhere. That\u2019s when we took a closer look at the execution policies and realized that something subtle was breaking our scripts. The Breakthrough: Signed Scripts and the PowerShell Execution Policy After analyzing the PowerShell Execution Policy settings, we noticed that the policy was configured to allow script execution, but it had an additional requirement:scripts needed to be signed. As shown above, the Powershell execution policy was set to \u201cAllow only signed scripts\u201d We then took a closer look at the scripts themselves, especially those provided by Patch My PC, and confirmed that all of them were signed. If you want to know how to sign a PowerShell script yourself, check out this blog from Patch My PC How to generate a code signing certificate and sign PowerShell .ps1 script \u2013 Patch My PC This confirmation should have meant that the scripts would execute successfully. However, even though the scripts were properly signed, the installation still wouldn\u2019t proceed. Something was missing. Our next step was to verify if the signing certificate was imported into the Trusted Publishers store on the device. This is a crucial requirement when the execution policy is set to allow only signed scripts. Without the certificate being trusted, PowerShell would block the script silently without giving any indication of failure. And that\u2019s exactly what we found, the certificate wasn\u2019t imported. The Missing Signing Certificate This explained everything: The installation process was being kicked off, but it would never execute. PowerShell was allowing the command to start, but when it came time to run the actual script, it failed silently. No errors, no warnings\u2014just a process that seemed to hang without any sign of progress. The Fix: Trust the Signing Certificates The solution turned out to be relatively simple but easily overlooked. For any signed scripts to run correctly, the signing certificate needs to be imported into theTrusted Publishersstore on every device. The installation guide below will show you the steps you need to take to make sure the Signing Certificate is imported by configuring a CSP. https://docs.patchmypc.com/installation-guides/patch-my-pc-cloud/reference/about-the-patch-my-pc-code-signing-certificate/using-a-custom-configuration-policy Wrapping Up: A Journey to the Root Cause What seemed like a straightforward issue with Win32 Apps stuck installing at 100% soon revealed itself as a more intricate problem, all triggered by a minor misconfiguration. When working with signed PowerShell scripts, it\u2019s essential to ensure the signing certificates are trusted by the system. Failing to do so can lead to elusive errors and odd behaviors that won\u2019t show up in your logs. So, the next time you notice Company Portal Win32 Apps stuck installing or Autopilot enrollments endlessly looping, don\u2019t just stop at checking your PowerShell Execution Policy\u2014make sure to review your certificate stores as well.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/ultimate-guide-troubleshoot-windows-autopilot/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The Ultimate Guide to Troubleshoot Windows Autopilot Device Preparation In this blog, I\u2019ll walk you through some powerful troubleshooting techniques to help you tackle issues duringWindows Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP), whether it\u2019s application installation failures or other bumps along the way. Introduction With the introduction ofWindows Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP), troubleshooting enrollment issues has become more critical, especially when problems likeapplication installation failuresarise. So, how do we determine what caused these issues? WhenAutopilot Device Preparationencounters a problem, you might see a message on the device saying thatdevice setup couldn\u2019t be completedand that you need to contact your organization\u2019s support. But wait, you\u2019re the support person, right? InAutopilot v1, we could easily use theenrollment status tracking CSPto pinpoint which apps failed to install. However, withWindows Autopilot Device Preparation, this process has changed. The familiarenrollment status pagewe used inAutopilot v1is no longer in play. Instead, thebootstrapperandIntune Management Extension (IME)now manage the entire provisioning flow. So, how can we troubleshootapplication installation failureswithWindows Autopilot Device Preparation? Let\u2019s walk through some basic troubleshooting steps you can take to identify the root cause. Autopilot Device Enrollment Monitor Microsoft gave us a lovely new Autopilot Device Enrollment monitor, which we could use to determine the deployment status. When you click on it, it provides an overview of the Autopilot deployment with additional details. By clicking on the report, you\u2019ll see additional details, including the status of apps and scripts marked as \u2018required\u2019 in theAutopilot Device Preparationprofile. But what if we ended up with something weird? What if the deployment looked successful, but somehow, there were no Apps listed in the report? Do we wait a few minutes (which is the ideal approach), dive into dissecting the entire enrollment process, or start by checking theKnown Issues? AP-DP Known Issues Before diving into new event logs, it\u2019s always a good idea to check for known issues with AP-DP. For instance, the App Control for Business Managed Installer might be the culprit behind your problem. I\u2019ve written about this before, showing how I discoveredthe managed installer was responsible for the broken application reporting.It\u2019s worth taking a look at that blog for context. Looks like Microsoft figured out the same thing. They\u2019ve documented it here:Known issue: Windows Autopilot device preparation with Win32 apps and managed installer policy | Microsoft Community Hub. In addition, thelocal administrator setting in Entramight also be disrupting the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment. In both cases, we ended up with a successful deployment, even though some required apps failed to install. If your issue isn\u2019t listed in theKnown Issues,it\u2019s time to roll up our sleeves and get to the heart of what went wrong with those app installations. The next step? Are we going to usethe get-windowsautopilotdiagnostics tool? Autopilot Diagnostics Tool Let me be blunt:NO, theGet-WindowsAutopilotDiagnostics.ps1tool isn\u2019t useful when we need to troubleshootAP-DPenrollment failures. It\u2019s designed for the originalAutopilot(APv1) and doesn\u2019t work forAutopilot Device Preparation (APv2) Instead, head over to the device itself. Once you\u2019re logged in, it\u2019s all about diving into the event logs. The good news is, with Autopilot Device Preparation, we\u2019ve got some fresh, shiny logs at our disposal. Ready to take a look? Troubleshooting AP-DP Bootstrapper Event Log and TSM Registry Key When your users experience strange errors duringAutopilot Device Preparation, troubleshooting can feel like a game of detective work (when not using the new Autopilot Monitor). Fortunately, several powerful methods are at your disposal to help you track down what\u2019s going wrong. Beyond theBootstrapper event logandAutopilotSettings TSM registry key, don\u2019t forget to check the DevicePreparation initial provider registry key, an essential part of the troubleshooting puzzle. Let\u2019s start with the Bootstrapper event log first! 1.Bootstrapper Event Log: Real-Time Updates TheBootstrapper event logis your go-to source for real-time information during theAutopilot Device Preparationprocess. As theBootstrapperAgentorchestrates the provisioning flow, it logs detailed steps, progress, and errors. These logs are generated through the Intune Management ExtensionBootstrapper Agent etw provider This agent captures key milestones such as: The start and completion of provisioning tasks Progress updates for various preparation steps Errors or issues encountered during the provisioning flow The real magic of this BootStrapper log? It gives you real-time insight into the entire provisioning process. Fun fact: this very bootstrapper log helped me uncover a bug in Autopilot Device Preparation that\u2019s now a known issue. Autopilot Device Preparation | Entra Local Administrator BugCheck it out here However, there is one caveat: theBootstrapper event logcurrently doesn\u2019t logapplication installation progressin full detail, Therefore, it may not be the go-to resource for troubleshooting app installation failures. Nevertheless, it\u2019s invaluable for tracking the overall process. 2.DevicePreparation Registry Key: Workload Progress Let\u2019s check the registry in addition to the Bootstrapper event logs. Specifically, we need to examine the AutopilotSettingsDevicePreparation registry key. As you can see above, the DevicePreparation registry key might reveal that the DevicePrepPage (DPP) agent provisioning failed. But, as always, it only gives you part of the story. Cracking the case of a broken Autopilot DPP enrollment is all about piecing together the clues! 3. Using the TSM Registry Key for Troubleshooting But if you unfold the DevicePreparation key, you will notice that there is aAutopilotSettings TSM registry keyinside of it. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\AutopilotSettings\\TSM Remember those clues we\u2019re piecing together? This registry key is another goldmine for unraveling the AP-DP mysteries. It stores information about the device preparation steps handled by the BootstrapperAgent. Each value here represents a specific step in the provisioning process and gives you insights like: StateType: The current state of the device preparation (e.g., \u201cInitializing,\u201d \u201cProvisioning\u201d). ProcessName: The process being executed at that moment. StateName: The step or status name, like \u201cApp Installation\u201d or \u201cDevice Enrollment.\u201d EventMessage: Messages or events tied to the current preparation step. We can also spot the collection of this telemetry information in the Bootstrapper Agent DLL When you combine this telemetry with the Bootstrapper event logs, you get a comprehensive view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and what might be going wrong. It\u2019s all about connecting the dots! 4. Initialprovisioning Registry Key If you\u2019re unsure which phase theAutopilot Device Preparationenrollment is in or if the Intune Management Extension (IME) seems to be doing something else while claiming to install required apps or scripts, the ProvisioningInitialprovisioningregistry keycan clarify the situation. TheInitialprovisoning registry keyholds the current workload progress inJSON format. When the device is enrolled, this workload information is sent to the device, updating the registry key as provisioning moves forward. By examining this key, you can verify the provisioning progress of theAutopilot Device Preparationsteps, and it helps confirm which phase the process is in (OrchestrationContext and Previous Progress). An important field to focus on is thePreviousProgressbatch. When opening this key we will notice that the previous workload phase before the error ocrured was theWin32apps provisioningphase. This insight can help pinpoint if the issue lies withapp installationsor another phase in the process. 5. Connecting the Dots: Combining Logs and Registry Keys By combining theBootstrapper event logs,AutopilotSettings TSM registry key, andDevicePreparation InitialProvisioning registry key, you get a clearer and more complete picture of theAutopilot Device Preparationprocess TheBootstrapper event loggives you real-time insights into the overall progress and any errors that occur during provisioning. TheAutopilotSettings TSM registry keyprovides a step-by-step snapshot of the device preparation state, allowing you to track progress and identify potential issues. TheDevicePreparationInitialProvisioning registry keygives you detailed information about the current workload and provisioning phase (in my case theWin32apps provisioningphase). When combined, these resources help you quickly pinpoint the issue and track the progress of theAutopilot Device Preparationprocess more effectively. 6.Pro Tip: Manually Activating the Bootstrapper Event Log One useful tip: theBootstrapper event logis automatically enabled when theIntune Management Extension (IME)is installed, but you can also manually activate theBootstrapper event log providerbefore the IME is installed. By registering the log provider withwevtutil, you can start collecting logs even before the IME gets involved, which could give you early insights into what\u2019s going wrong. While theBootstrapper event logsandAutopilotSettings TSM registry keysprovide useful insights into the overallAutopilot Device Preparationprocess, they don\u2019t always give us the fine-grained details needed to pinpoint issues withapp installations. If theAutopilot Device Enrollment MonitororBootstrapper logsdon\u2019t provide enough clarity, it\u2019s time to dive into more detailed troubleshooting. This is where theIME logscome in handy. Let\u2019s explore how to useCMTraceand theIME logsto troubleshoot app installation failures more precisely. IME Event Log Troubleshooting If you\u2019ve discovered thatAutopilotis stuck on theWin32App provisioningworkload (as indicated by theTSMorProvisioning logs), your issue is likely related toapp installation failures. While theAutopilot Device Preparation logsandregistry keysgive you an excellent high-level overview of the provisioning process, they don\u2019t specifically track the detailed progress or success of application installations. This is where theIntune Management Extension (IME)logs come in handy. TheIME logswill provide you with the detailed information you need to troubleshootWin32 app installation issuesand identify what went wrong during the provisioning process. As shown above, even with all the new Windows Autopilot device Preparation event logs, the Intune Management Extension should tell us enough! When we zoom in, we will notice that the Reporting registry key holds all the information about whether the application itself is detected. If the detection state is 2, the application is not detected. If the detection state is 1, the application is detected. Once you find the one with the wrong detection state, note theGUID, as this GUID is the APPID. With this App ID, you know which application was not detected. If you don\u2019t want to spend time in the Intune Management Event log, you can also copy and paste that ID after this URL to find out which app it was https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Apps/SettingsMenu/~/0/appId But maybe it\u2019s easier to open the ProvisioningProgress registry key just above the reporting one, as that registry key also holds the WorkloadID (appid) and the Friendlyname, which could make more sense. CMTrace and the IME Log: Uncovering Installation Failures While the Autopilot Device Preparation logs and IME registry keys offer valuable insights, you can take it a step further by using the CMTrace tool to dive deeper into the Intune Management Extension (IME) logs. CMTrace, originally developed by Microsoft as part of the Configuration Manager toolkit, is a powerful log viewer that makes analyzing IME logs much easier. It highlights errors and warnings, helping you quickly pinpoint issues like application installation failures or failed detections. For instance, in earlier troubleshooting efforts, CMTrace helped us identify theManagedInstallerStatusas the root cause. However, here\u2019s the catch: Microsoft no longer provides a direct download link for CMTrace. If you don\u2019t already have it, you\u2019ll need to extract it from a Configuration Manager installation or obtain it through alternative methods. Despite this, it remains an invaluable tool for effectively troubleshooting IME logs. Spotting Application Installation Failures TheIME logs (Appworkload)provide detailed information about each step in theAutopilot Device Preparationprocess, includingapplication installation. UsingCMTrace, you can quickly find anyapplication installation failuresby filtering for errors or issues related to app installation. The logs will often point to specific applicationdetection failuresor issues with the applicationWorkloadID, which corresponds to theAppID. The power ofCMTracelies in its ability to highlight errors, show you the sequence of actions, and even offer useful context for identifying the exact cause of installation failures. Patch My PC\u2019s IME Deep Dive Webinar If you\u2019re unsure how to approach the application troubleshooting process or want to gain more in-depth knowledge of theIME log, you\u2019re in luck.Patch My PChas already conducted an excellentIME Deep-Dive Webinar, which goes into detail on how to troubleshootapplication installation failuresusing theIME logs. Although the IME Deep Dive Webinar focuses on troubleshooting IME-specific issues, the knowledge gained can also be directly applied to troubleshooting Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) issues. If an application fails to install duringAutopilot, usingCMTraceand analyzing theIME logswill help you pinpoint exactly where things went wrong, whether it\u2019s a detection issue, a missing dependency, or a conflict during the provisioning process. Conclusion: When Autopilot encounters issues during the Device Preparation process, the first step is to check the Autopilot Monitor. The monitor provides a quick overview of the deployment status, helping you identify any workloads that might be causing delays or failures. However, it doesn\u2019t always give you all the details you need to troubleshoot complex issues. That\u2019s where theBootstrapper event logandProvisioning registry keyscome into play. These tools offer deeper insights into the current state of the Autopilot Device Preparation process, helping you pinpoint exactly where things are getting stuck. Once you\u2019ve identified the failing workload\u2014whether it\u2019s app provisioning or another step\u2014you can take things further by analyzing theIME logs. These logs provide the granular details needed to troubleshoot specific issues. If the Autopilot Monitor is lacking critical information (or if you\u2019d rather not wait for updates), diving into the logs is your next logical step. With tools likeCMTrace, you can quickly uncover the root cause of the problem, whether it\u2019s a detection issue, a missing dependency, or another configuration conflict. By combining the insights from theTSM registry keys,Bootstrapper logs, andIME logs, you\u2019ll have a comprehensive view of the process, making it easier to resolve issues and get your Autopilot enrollment back on track.

Enter the arena,Line-of-business app (LOB) vs. Windows app (Win32). So, you want to create an application in Microsoft Intune. You think: \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for years with good old Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM/MECM/MCM); how hard can it be?\u201d You quickly log into your Intune portal and enter the \u2018All apps\u2019 area. Next, you notice the seemingly harmless \u2018+add\u2019 button towards the top of the page and dive in. Stunned, you mutter, \u201cWhat is this stuff?\u201d Moving to the \u201cWindows\u201d platform section, your choices become clearer. This article helps you determine the best selection and simplifies creating applications in Intune. What is a Line-of-Business App (LOB)? Before the application types square off, it is essential to understand every kind of application and its strengths and weaknesses. In one corner are the Line-of-Business apps, which are commonly referred to as LOB apps. LOB apps are a staple of Intune and date back to its earliest days. LOB apps only require the creator to provide an installation file for the created application. The supported installation file types include MSI, MSIX, MSIXBUNDLE, APPX, and APPXBUNDLE. It sounds simple enough; every application has an MSI-based installer, right? When new to creating applications in Microsoft Intune, administrators tend to lean towards LOB apps for one primary reason: convenience. After you have selected and uploaded your installation file, much of what remains is minimal, including entering any custom installation parameters that the provided file might support. Creating a LOB App From the Windows Apps Section, select the option to add an app, and select \u2018Line-of-Business App\u2019 from the app type menu: The list of supported file types for a Windows LOB app is displayed: Select the file for your app package (selection of an MSI for 7-Zip shown below): Some required fields may be populated if an MSI file type has been selected, but others will still need to be manually populated. Populate all required fields, additional parameters, and other desired application information, such as an icon file for the application: Assignments to Azure Active Directory (AAD) groups can be added during the initial creation process. LOB apps assigned as available will be displayed in the Company Portal for end-users. A required assignment is shown below: The last section will show a summation of what has been configured before the selection of the \u2018Create\u2019 button to publish the application: After the application is created, you can review and change the properties shown below: LOB App Pros: Native MDM App Model Native MDM App Model Does not Rely on the Intune Management Extension (IME) Does not Rely on the Intune Management Extension (IME) Ease of Creation Ease of Creation Quick to Update(?) Quick to Update(?) Easy to Maintain(?) Easy to Maintain(?) Support for a Wider Range of Operating Systems (not just Windows) Support for a Wider Range of Operating Systems (not just Windows) No Scripting/Packaging Required No Scripting/Packaging Required LOB App Cons: Limited Installation File Type Support Limited Installation File Type Support Only Supports a Single Installation File Only Supports a Single Installation File File Size Limitations File Size Limitations No Support for Complex Installers No Support for Complex Installers Cannot Support Applications That Require More than One Installation File Cannot Support Applications That Require More than One Installation File Not as Versatile Not as Versatile Limited Customization Limited Customization What is a Windows app (Win32)? In the other corner are Windows apps, or what they are commonly referred to as: Win32 apps. A Win32 app is just that, designed for Windows that supports 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. This is one of the largest misconceptions around Win32 apps as, at a glance, the name suggests that they are not compatible with a 64-bit Windows operating system; however, they very much are as the \u201c32\u201d in Win32 is a reference to the Windows API used for programming which supports 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. All of the programming talk aside, a Win32 app is another application type choice within Intune that most closely resembles the \u201capplication model\u201d from Microsoft Configuration Manager, with which many admins are familiar. Win32 apps allow for greater control and flexibility when creating a managed application. With more flexibility, Win32 apps give the creator more options regarding the actual deployment of their content. The support for multiple files, detection methods, supersedence chains, and install/uninstall commands are just a few examples of how a Win32 app can give more control to the creator to have the application perform as designed. As a result, Win32 apps must be packaged, a word that sometimes scares away many admins. Due to their nature, flexibility, and support for multiple files (and the .EXE file type), Win32 apps must be compiled within the IntuneWin wrapper with the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool. If you find yourself saying, \u201cThis is all getting a little blurry; give me something that can automate that process for me,\u201d fear not! There will be more on that later. Creating a Win32 App Before creating a Win32 app, the application content must be packaged with the Win32 Content Prep Tool. The tool will bundle and wrap all the application content within a .intunewin file. The created .intunewin file will be used when creating the application within Intune. Download and unpack the Win32 Content Prep Tool from the following GitHub repository: GitHub \u2013 microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool: A tool to wrap Win32 App, and then it can be uploaded to Intune When utilizing the Win32 Content Prep Tool, always using the latest version is essential. A warning stating that the app content was packaged with an older version will be displayed if you are not using the latest version. The extracted contents of the tool are shown below, with the critical file being the \u2018IntuneWinAppUtil\u2019 executable: Prepare the content for the application that is being created. The installation file and all associated files (remember Winn32 apps can support multiple files) should be stored in the same directory (7-Zip MSI shown below): Launch the Win32 App Content Prep tool by executing the \u2018IntuneWinAppUtil\u2019 executable. When the utility loads, you will need to specify the following information: Source Folder \u2013 the directory where you are storing the app content Source Folder \u2013 the directory where you are storing the app content Setup File \u2013 the main install file for the application install (7-Zip shown below) Setup File \u2013 the main install file for the application install (7-Zip shown below) Output Folder \u2013 where you want the compiled .intunewin file saved Output Folder \u2013 where you want the compiled .intunewin file saved When the utility finishes you should see the compiled file saved in the directory specified when running the content prep tool. You can think of the created .intunewin file as a ZIP file. It will be the file that is downloaded and subsequently automatically unpacked on Windows endpoints when they are processing and installing the content. It is also the required file needed when creating Win32 apps within Intune manually: Adding the Win32App to Intune Time to create the application. From the Windows Apps Section select the option to add an app, and then select the \u2018Windows app (Win32)\u2019 from the app type menu: Dialog is displayed, indicating that a .intunewin file is required (hey, we just made that!): Select the option to choose an app package file, then browse to and select the created .intunewin file created from the Win32 Content Prep Tool: After selecting the file, additional parameters and information can be added to the application. Some fields will be pre-populated depending on the installation file type. Other required fields will be marked as such and must be completed before advancing. This is a good time to upload an icon image file to be displayed in the Company Portal if you are planning to make the application available for installation for end-users: The \u2018Program\u2019 tab is where you will start to see the benefits and flexibility allowed with Win32 apps. As before, some fields are required and will be auto-populated for you. However, you also have the flexibility to customize the install and uninstall commands (default populated commands for 7-Zip ver. 23.01 shown below). Device restart Behavior Device restart behavior options can be beneficial, allowing you to control post-install behavior for the operating system. Suppose the option to determine the behavior based on return codes is chosen (shown below). In that case, you have even more granular control over what will occur when specific return codes are received following an application running the configured install command line. You can even add and remove return codes and alter what a particular return code type is for the application: Configuring the Requirements The\u2018Requirements\u2019tab is where you can specify conditions that the endpoints must meet to process the application assignment. This is another example of the granular control options that accompany Win32 apps. Being able to specify a minimum level of the endpoint operating system is a simple way to allow particular applications on particular versions of Windows: Configuring the Detection Rules In the \u2018Detection Rules\u2019tab, you must specify the settings to determine whether the application is installed. Detection rules are required for Win32 apps, much like applications created within Microsoft Configuration Manager. Detection methods are another way to curate and verify that the application is installed to your specifications. When defining the rules for detection for a Win32 app, there are two main options: manually configuring the detection rule (shown below) and the ability to use a custom PowerShell script. For this example we will utilize the option to manually configure the detection rule and select a rule type of \u2018MSI\u2019 where the MSI product code will be automatically populated: Configuring the Dependencies In the \u2018Dependencies\u2019 tab you can specify additional Win32 apps that must be installed before installing the current application. This is another powerful option when there is a need for specific applications to have other specific, required applications installed to be installed successfully: Configuring Supersedence In the\u2018Supersedence\u2019tab, you can control whether or not you want the Win32 app being created to be installed in the place of another already-assigned version. This feature can make it easy to automatically offer the latest version of an application to end-users within the Company Portal: Configuring the assignments Assignments to Entra groups can also be added during the initial creation process. Win32 apps assigned as \u201cavailable\u201d will be displayed in the Company Portal for end-users. A required assignment is shown below: A summation page is displayed for review before selecting the option to create the application: After the application is created the properties and assignments can be modified as shown below: Win 32 App Pros: Natively Supports the Intune Management Extension (IME) Natively Supports the Intune Management Extension (IME) Support for a Wider Range of File Types (EXEs) Support for a Wider Range of File Types (EXEs) Support for Multiple Files Within an Installer (Complex Installs) Support for Multiple Files Within an Installer (Complex Installs) Support for Larger Install Files Support for Larger Install Files More Robust and Flexible Option Set More Robust and Flexible Option Set Support for Detection Methods Support for Detection Methods Dependencies Dependencies Supersedence Supersedence Win32 App Cons: Relies on the Intune Management Extension (IME) Relies on the Intune Management Extension (IME) Requires Packaging with Content Prep Tool (must be .intunewin format) Requires Packaging with Content Prep Tool (must be .intunewin format) Manual Creation Can be Time-Consuming Manual Creation Can be Time-Consuming Conflicts According to the gospel of Microsoft themselves, conflicts can occur, primarily during Autopilot device provisioning, if a mixture of LOB apps and Win32 apps are targeted to an endpoint. Troubleshoot Win32 apps in Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn The short version and critical takeaway is that if you elect to use any Win32 applications in your environment, use them exclusively to make your life easier. The primary reason behind this is that LOB apps and Win32 apps both use the trusted installer service within Windows; however, only Win32 apps utilize the Intune Management Extension (IME) as well. The IME is the entity that keeps Win32 apps in line. Whereas Win32 applications will line up in a single file line and wait their turn for processing through the IME, LOB apps do not use the IME. This can lead toanarchyissues where LOB apps and Win32 apps being processed at the same time will fight over the trusted installer service and can lock one another out of it, subsequently causing application install failure chaos. Please keep it simple; don\u2019t cross the streams. The Showdown: LOB vs. Win32 That is all a lot to unpack. Hopefully, the winner of this showdown will be readily apparent through the details of how to create each type of application alone. While they can be more complex to develop, the robustness and flexibility accompanying all of the options of Win32 apps make them the clear choice in the eyes of most administrators. Typically, administrators needing to manage applications in their environment need many options to make their lives easier in the long run, as well as drive up the compliance and install success rate of the applications in their environment. If you need options and more control over the customization and installation logic of the managed applications in your environment, look for nothing other than Win32 applications. Before you go, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI want to use Win32 applications, but they take too long to manage.\u201d Enter the arena, Patch My PC.

Everything looks good, and you\u2019re feeling confident. Then, bam, your devices lock after just a couple of minutes of inactivity. Users are confused, support is blowing up, and you\u2019re left thinking, \u201cI didn\u2019t set any lock settings like this\u2026 so what the heck happened?\u201dSurprise, it\u2019s not a bug, and it\u2019s not something you missed in your configurations. The real culprit\u2026 a compliance policy that is using the DeviceLock CSP.. What\u2019s Really Happening? You were right to second-guess yourself. \u201cI didn\u2019t set this up\u2026 so what the heck is going on?\u201d If you\u2019re like most admins, you\u2019ve probably been configuring your Intune policies, feeling confident that everything\u2019s under control. But then, all of a sudden, devices across the company start locking after just a few minutes of inactivity. So, what went wrong? Well, here\u2019s where the wild goose chase begins. We started by checking the usual suspects: Security Baselines, Endpoint security Policies, and device configurations. Everything seemed fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. But then\u2026 we noticed something strange on the device itself: registry keys showing up in the PolicyManager\\Current\\device\\DeviceLock path. We didn\u2019t set those devicelock settings. So, why were they there? That\u2019s when we realized: this wasn\u2019t an accident. It was the clue we were searching for. The Hunt Continues: Finding the DeviceLock Setting We dove deeper into the issue, and that\u2019s when it clicked. The registry keys were linked to the DeviceLock behavior. As we investigated further, we found that the DeviceLock CSP relies on the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) policy engine. That\u2019s right, EAS was silently enforcing security settings. TheDeviceLock CSPutilizes theExchange ActiveSync (EAS)policy engine. With the DeviceLock CSP relying on EAS, it was clear that the corresponding registry keys in the control\\eas\\policies path were also showing up. It wasn\u2019t just syncing email and calendar settings; EAS was also enforcing device security policies, including theMaxInactivityTimeDeviceLocksetting, which controls how long a device can stay idle before locking. And just like that, all our devices were locked into a 5-minute inactivity timeout. Users had to enter their PIN far sooner than expected. The Hidden Culprit Once we connected the dots, it all made sense. TheMaxInactivityTimeDeviceLocksetting wasn\u2019t configured manually by us, EAS was pushing it out. Want to know what triggered it? It was automatically deployed the moment a specificDevice Security compliance policywas applied. Take a look at the above compliance policy in question: it had a setting called \u201cMaximum minutes of inactivity before password is required,\u201d set to 1 minute. The second this compliance policy was applied, EAS kicked in and pushed these settings to all devices. Even though you didn\u2019t configure the inactivity timeout yourself, EAS took care of it, syncing the setting across the entire fleet. That\u2019s why all your devices started locking after just a minute of inactivity. EAS and the DeviceLock CSP This is where EAS really shines.The DeviceLock CSP uses EAS to enforce device lock settings, like password complexity and inactivity timeouts. When you configure a compliance policy involving device lock settings, EAS doesn\u2019t just check for compliance; it actively pushes and enforces(remediates) those settings across all devices in the fleet. For example, when you set password length and complexity rules, EAS ensures that all local user and administrator accounts are marked to change their password at the next sign-in to meet the complexity requirements. The same mechanism works with device lock settings, applying those policies to every device in the fleet without requiring manual intervention. So, while theDeviceLock CSPis all about managing security-related settings on the device,EASacts as the enforcer, making sure these settings are applied across the board. Best Practices and How to Avoid Surprises Now that we\u2019ve solved the mystery, let\u2019s talk about how to avoid this kind of surprise in the future. Here are a few best practices that will help keep your devices secure without triggering unexpected behavior: Review compliance policy settings carefully: Before rolling out any compliance policies, especially those involving security features like lock screens or inactivity timeouts, double-check exactly what they will apply to your devices. Some of them might trigger automatic enforcement. Understand how EAS works with compliance policies: It\u2019s crucial to understand that EAS doesn\u2019t just check for compliance; it can alsoapplysettings to your devices. If your compliance policy involves device lock settings, be prepared for EAS to sync those across your entire fleet. Audit device behavior: If devices are locking unexpectedly, dive into theEAS sync logsandregistry settingsto see what\u2019s been applied. This will help you understand exactly what changed and why. Test before full deployment: As always, test your compliance policies on a small set of devices before deploying them across the company. This allows you to catch any unexpected behaviors before they affect everyone. Adjust the settings if needed: If you don\u2019t want devices locking after just a few minutes, go back to your compliance policy and tweak the inactivity timeout settings. Make sure they align with your organization\u2019s needs. Conclusion: Wrapping It Up So, there you have it, the mystery behind the weird lock screen issue is solved. It wasn\u2019t a bug, and it wasn\u2019t a random glitch. It wasa Compliance Policy, quietly enforcing device lock settings pushed by your compliance policies. The key takeaway here?Don\u2019t just set and forget your compliance policies.Understand how they interact with other features like EAS, and always double-check what settings might be silently enforced in the background. A little upfront knowledge can save you from a lot of user complaints and support tickets down the road. Stay tuned, there\u2019s always more to uncover when it comes to managing devices in Intune, and who knows what other surprises might be lurking just around the corner!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/clear-tpm-dell-device/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Clearing the TPM on a Dell Device: Why the EKpub and Offline Device ID Change Introduction In our last Patch Tuesday blog, we discussedTPM attestation failures that are happening on Windows 11 24H2, specifically during the Endorsement Key (EK) Verify phase. This caused Windows Autopilot for Pre-Deployments enrollments to fail. To dig deeper, I decided to investigate what should happen during aClear TPM (Trusted Platform Module)operation. Using `Get-WindowsAutopilotinfo` to capture thehardware hashandOA3Toolto decode it. While doing so, I noticed something unusual: clearing the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) on one Dell device resulted in a newEKpuband a differentOffline Device ID,which should NOT happen at all!!! This behavior didn\u2019t occur on other devices I tested, like those from HP and Lenovo. To understand why this is problematic, we first need to review how aClear TPMoperation is supposed to work. What Should Happen During a Clear TPM Operation Before looking at the issue, we need to have a good understanding of what the Clear-TPM PowerShell command should do. AClear TPMoperation is meant to reset the TPM to its default state without impacting its core identity. Here\u2019s the standard flow: Check TPM Ownership:Determines if the TPM is owned. Ownership means the system has control over the TPM\u2019s functions. If ownership hasn\u2019t been established, provisioning continues to set it. Check TPM Ownership:Determines if the TPM is owned. Ownership means the system has control over the TPM\u2019s functions. If ownership hasn\u2019t been established, provisioning continues to set it. Provision SRK (Storage Root Key):The SRK is the master key used to secure all other keys and data within the TPM chip. This step resets and provisions the SRK. Provision SRK (Storage Root Key):The SRK is the master key used to secure all other keys and data within the TPM chip. This step resets and provisions the SRK. Provision EK (Endorsement Key):The EK is a unique, manufacturer-provided key used to validate the TPM\u2019s authenticity. It doesn\u2019t change unless explicitly reset by commands likeTPM2_ChangeEPS.

Publish Final Status:Updates the system to indicate that provisioning is complete and the TPM is ready for use. Publish Final Status:Updates the system to indicate that provisioning is complete and the TPM is ready for use. Clearing the TPM on Dell Devices Using the tools below, I found that the Dell device deviated from this standard flow. Steps I Took: 1.Exporting the Hardware Hash: Before clearing the TPM, I ran the following to capture the hardware hash: `Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile \u201cpre-clear-hash.csv\u201d`2. Decoding the Hardware Hash: I used theOA3Toolto decode the EKpub and compare the hardware hash:`oa3tool /decodehwhash=\u201dthe hash from the pre-clear-hash.csv\u201d3.Clearing the TPM: I cleared the TPM through the BIOS/UEFI.4.Repeating the Process Post-Clear:After clearing the TPM, I exported and decoded the new hardware hash: `Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile \u201cpost-clear-hash.csv\u201d``oa3tool /decodehwhash=\u201d the hash from the post-clear-hash.csv\u201d Findings: (fasten your seatbelt) \u2013The EKpub Changed!!!!!: Comparing the decoded EKpub values showed that they were different before and after the Clear TPM operation.\u2013 The Offline Device ID Changed!!!!: The Offline Device ID, derived from TPM measurements like the EKpub, also changed. One thing is for sure:this should never ever happen when clearing the TPM. Why the EKpub Should Never Change when clearing the TPM According to TPM specifications: The EKpub Is Deterministic:The EKpub is always derived from the EPS and a predefined template. As long as the EPS remains unchanged, the EKpub stays the same. Clear TPM Does Not Reset the EPS:A Clear TPM operation resets user-created data (like the SRK) but retains the EPS. Resetting the EPS would be a significant event, usually requiring a specific command like `TPM2_ChangeEPS`. The Offline Device ID Relies on EKpub Stability:Since the Offline Device ID is tied to the EKpub, any change in the EKpub results in a different device ID. This can disruptAttestation during Windows Autopilot Pre-Provisioningand lead toAutopilot time-outissues as well. Source:TCG Credential Profile EK 2.0 Why This Matters Attestation Failures:The EKpub is tied to the EK certificate (EKcert). If the EKpub changes, the EKcert becomes invalid, breaking the attestation process. This likely explains the0x80070490 errorI discussed in my previous blog. Device Identity Problems: The Offline Device ID, which is derived from theEKpub,also changes. I guess with a new device ID and a new EKPub, the device looks totally different! Inconsistent Behavior Across Devices: Clearing the TPM on devices from HP and Lenovo doesn\u2019t affect the EKpub or Offline Device ID. Only a subset of Dell devices that are using the STM chipset have this issue! So it could be very difficult to find the culprit! Final Thoughts Clearing the TPM should reset user-created data and keys, but it should NEVER (and I do mean NEVER!) change the EKpub or Offline Device ID. On this Dell device, something in the Clear TPM process altered the EKpub, causing downstream issues with attestation and device provisioning. While the exact cause isn\u2019t clear, whether it\u2019s firmware-related or a TPM-specific implementation.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-hello-for-business-shows-a-blank-set-up-a-pin-screen/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows Hello for Business Shows a Blank Set up A PIN Screen? This blog is abouta frustrating issue in which Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) shows the \u201cSet up a PIN\u201d screen but fails to display the PIN input field. 1. Set up A Pin Issue on Reddit It started with aReddit post. Someone tagged me asking for help with a strange issue: the Windows Hello for Business(WHfB)\u201cSet up a PIN\u201d screen appeared, but no PIN input field was shown. It first looked like it was trying to do something, but the textbox simply wasn\u2019t there and wasn\u2019t showing up. Also, trying to manually add a PIN through Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options led to the same brokenSet Up A Pin state. As shown above, there was absolutely no option to enter or set up a PIN. At first, it looked like a familiar misconfiguration or a CIS baseline breaking Windows Hello For Business (which wouldn\u2019t surprise me) 2. Reproducing the Set up A Pin Issue The original poster offered a test account and the option to upload the device hash, so I could try reproducing it myself. I uploaded the hash into my lab environment and ran through an Autopilot deployment on a VM. Sure enough, I hit the exact same issue: the WHfB screen appeared, but there was no place to enter a PIN. Going through Settings also gave me a broken UI. Something was clearly interfering, but everything looked correct on the surface. At this point, I had to move from surface-level configuration to what the system was actually doing. 3. Stripping Down Intune Policies\u2026 But Carefully Whenever you suspect configuration issues, isolating the environment is key. I created a dedicated Entra group, added only my test VM, and excluded it from any potentially interfering policies. In this case, a CIS Level 1 security baseline was assigned to the targeted Autopilot devices. While these baselines are valuable from a security perspective, they often tighten control over user experience features and could potentially also break stuff like setting up a PIN with WHfB. I excluded the device from the CIS baseline entirely. No other configuration profiles seemed responsible. Still, no change. The PIN input remained missing. 4. Dsregcmd Was All Good I ran dsregcmd /status and confirmed that everything looked healthy: IsDeviceJoined = YES NgcPrerequisiteCheck = willProvision PolicyEnabled = YES TPM present and functional This meant that WHfB prerequisites were fulfilled, and according to the system, the provisioning workflow should be able to proceed. Yet the option to set up a PIN with WHfB didn\u2019t show up. 5. Time to Launch Procmon With the usual suspects (CIS) cleared, it was time to dive in a bit more. I opened Process Monitor (Procmon) and triggered the WHfB setup again, this time via the Settings > Set up a PIN option. While watching Procmon in real-time, I filtered on CredentialUIBroker.exe, the process responsible for handling sign-in UI interactions. I noticed that CredentialUIBroker.exe was querying the following registry path: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Authentication\\Credential Providers. It was iterating through the registered credential providers. One of them stood out:{D6886603-9D2F-4EB2-B667-1971041FA96B}. Under that key, there was a value called Disabled, which was set to 1. That caught my attention. 6. What That GUID Actually Is That GUID corresponds to the Windows Hello PIN credential provider, the part of the system that renders and handles the PIN setup UI. By setting Disabled = 1, Windows hides the provider from the system. It won\u2019t show up as an available authentication method. There\u2019s no visible error, just the absence of the option to set up a PIN. WHfB provisioning appears to run, but the user interaction needed to set up the PIN never starts. This was the missing link. The environmentwantedto provision WHfB, but the necessary UI component was blocked at a lower level. 7. So Where Did That Setting Come From? I hadn\u2019t applied this manually, and there was no longer a CIS baseline targeted, so I moved on to checking what was being executed by theIntune Management Extension. I opened AgentExecutor.log from the IME logs and found that a PowerShell script had been executed on the device. There it was\u2026a PowerShell script that configured the{D6886603-9D2F-4EB2-B667-1971041FA96B} to be disabled. After finding the PowerShell script ID, I opened the Intune portal and looked up the PowerShell script. The script was named HideOtherUser.ps1, which seemed completely unrelated. But after using Microsoft Graph and decoding the base64 content, this is what it contained: So, despite the name, the script wasn\u2019t hiding the \u201cOther user\u201d login option; it was, in fact, disabling the PIN credential provider. 8. Silent Sabotage This script had been silently deployed via Intune. It didn\u2019t throw errors, alert the user, or get flagged by the WHfB setup process. A simple registry value added by a misnamed script derailed the whole Windows Hello For Business (WHfB) experience. These kinds of configuration conflicts are the most difficult to detect because everything appears normal until you rule out everything else and end up with a PowerShell script. 9. The Set up A Pin not Showing Fix I first tested a simple change by setting the Disabled value to 0: After closing the Set up A Pin screen and reopening it, the PIN setup screen worked perfectly. WHfB completed without issue. Once verified, I updated the Intune script assignment to exclude this device and prevent reapplication. That ensured the fix would stick. 10. Final Thoughts When troubleshooting issues like a missing PIN screen in Windows Hello for Business, start by ruling out what you can. Exclude the device from baselines. Strip away configuration profiles (don\u2019t remove them\u2026 exclude your test device!). Confirm the obvious before diving deeper. In this case, it wasn\u2019t a settings catalog policy or a CIS baseline. It was a PowerShell script that silently disabled the PIN credential provider. Easy to miss unless you know where to look. Always check what scripts are running on the device, review the logs, and use Procmon to see what the system is doing. Sometimes, it\u2019s not a misconfiguration, it\u2019s a PowerShell script breaking something you didn\u2019t expect.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/quick-machine-recovery-built-in-resilience-windows-24h2/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Quick Machine Recovery: Built-In Resilience for Windows 24H2 This blog is about a new kind of silent recovery built intoWindows 24h2 (KB5062660). It\u2019s not about Safe Mode or Startup Repair, but something more powerful! Something that can quietly bring all of your devices back when they can no longer boot to Windows. We\u2019re diving into something new called:Quick Machine Recovery. When Windows devices fail to boot There\u2019s a moment every IT admin fears: a fleet of Windows devices suddenly fails to boot. There is no clear error (only a nonsensical BSOD stating that your PC encountered a problem), no USB recovery media nearby (or a team of IT admins), and no way to intervene at scale. This is exactly what happened during the infamousCrowdStrikeincident! Machines started to crash into blue screens of death across the globe. Recovery wasn\u2019t just about fixing one device; It was about repairing thousands of them. That\u2019s the kind of chaosQuick Machine Recoveryis meant to deal with. A New Kind of Cloud Quick Machine Recovery Quick Machine Recovery, also known asCloud Remediation(orRecoveryRobustness), is a feature now built into theWindows Recovery Environment(WinRE). Unlike traditional repair options that rely on user intervention, it activates automatically when the system detects failure. Check out the YouTube video below to find out what it looks like whenQuick Machine recoverykicks in and tries to find a solution for the issue (in this case, the test mode was activated) It\u2019s driven by recovery settings in SrSettings.ini, evaluated by StartRep.exe (Executable responsible for the Quick Machine Recovery, which is located in the winre: x:\\sources\\recovery ) The whole cloud remediation process is pretty straightforward: it checks if flags/settings like CloudRemediation, AutoRemediation, and optionally HeadlessMode are set. If the environment meets the conditions (such as an available network and required plugin), Windows silently initiates recovery. How to Enable Quick Machine Recovery QMR can be configured through theRemoteRemediation CSPin Intune. You can deploy this policy by defining the corrosponding CSP: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/RemoteRemediation/CloudRemediationSettings Or use the new Remote Remediation settings catalog to enabled Cloud Remediation Once enabled, Cloud Recovery decisions become policy-driven rather than relying on manual intervention. Simulating a Failure with Quick Machine Recovery Microsoft includes a test pathway for Quick Machine Recovery, by calling the reagentc.exe /setrecoverytestmode (WinReSetRecoveryTestMode) function. This will place a simulation file (RecoverySimulation.ini) in the system32\\recovery folder. This file contains flags such as: [Recovery] Active=Yes HeadlessMode=Yes AutoRemediation=Yes CloudRemediation=Yes Besides the recovery file, it will also configure the RUN registry key inside the reliabilitysrt registry key. Once this recovery file and the run key are created, the device will reboot into WinRE, triggering the logic that would typically run in a failure scenario. Behind the Curtain: The Quick Machine Recovery Flow When the recovery sequence starts,StartRep.exebegins parsing the configuration. The ReadRecoverySettings function determines whether CloudRemediation is allowed, whether AutoRemediation is on, and whether HeadlessMode is set. If all checks pass and a network-compatible plugin is present, recovery starts. Upon examining the plugin\u2019s code, the BootCriticalUpdatePlugin.dll is loaded at step 4. For now, it\u2019s the only plugin that is loaded when the Quick Machine Recovery is initializing From there on, it leverages the BcuUsoHelper component to scan for, download, and apply the remediations defined in the remediations.ini. If everything succeeds, the system will be rebooted, and your device will be up and running again! If you are interested in the detailed flow of how the first few steps behind this functionality work, you may want to review the flow (based on the code of the startrep init function). You can download it here: No UI Required: Headless Recovery Headless Mode is another thing that caught my attention. We spotted this mode in the reagent log and the recovery settings config file. While not really documented in Microsoft\u2019s documentation, HeadlessMode is recognized internally and handled by the ReadRecoverySettings function. It\u2019s part of the logic flow when the reagent checks all the settings. When looking at the code\u2026 this is what it tells me The Evidence is in the Logs The remediation process leaves behind logs in the system32\\logfile\\ssrt and the reagent folder. If you inspect setupact.log, you\u2019ll find all the information you need to know what happened: StarRep.exe is doing the work! AutoRemediation Setting = On Plugin initialized: BootCriticalUpdatePlugin.dll Scan, download, install result: success As shown above, the log file captures every step that Cloud Remediation takes. (which made it way easier to find the corresponding code) But how could the device access my drive with BitLocker enabled? What About BitLocker? While playing around with Quick Machine recovery, BitLocker was enabled to protect my drive. Somehow, Quick Machine Recovery could still access the local drive? As if BitLocker wasn\u2019t even there. As shown below, the BootCriticalUpdatePlugin could still load the software/system registry hives from the local drive to inspect them. This might seem strange at first, but it actually makes sense when you look at how BitLocker works behind the scenes. When the recovery environment (WinRE) is launched from the same internal disk, and nothing about the boot process has changed (like Secure Boot, the boot order, or firmware settings), the system still trusts the environment. Because of that, the TPM can unlock the drive automatically without asking for the BitLocker recovery key. It uses something called PCR values (Platform Configuration Registers) to check if the system is in the same state it was when BitLocker was set up. If everything matches, it quietly unlocks the drive. So yeah, in this case,WinRE could access the encrypted disk just finebecause everything looked normal and trusted from the TPM and BitLocker\u2019s point of view. Why It Matters This is how Windows could recover on its own when issues are found. We no longer need USB or IT admins running from one computer to another and the next and the next. Just one Intune policy to enable Cloud Remediation. Quick Machine Recovery is a response to large-scale crises, such as CrowdStrike\u2019s meltdown. It gives enterprises a fallback path when things go sideways. Quick Machine Recovery Conclusion Quick Machine Recovery is a glimpse of modern, scalable remediation. If you manage Intune-enrolled devices, enabling this QMR feature could be the difference between a quick rebound and hours of lost productivity (AKA money). There is no UI, no panic, just silent cloud recovery in the background, which is exactly what we need when our devices are stuck on a BSOD!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-custom-compliance-policies/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Configuring Intune Custom Compliance Policies for Third-Party Applications Introduction to Intune Custom Compliance Policy Businesses constantly experiment with new technology and third-party apps to complete tasks swiftly in our fast-paced digital age. The catch is that it\u2019s crucial to make sure these managed devices and apps abide by the guidelines. You must ensure that everything, from your user and device groups to your organizational data, is secure and that you are following the rules. For our benefit, Microsoft Intune has a clever trick up its sleeve called Intune Custom Compliance Policies. In this blog post, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to use this device and Intune compliance policies to determine whether your third-party apps are abiding by the guidelines. We will make sure your environment and devices are compliant, and we will monitor the Intune compliance policy settings and status. We will be using PowerShell Discovery scripts and JSON files to complete these tasks, but it won\u2019t be as difficult as it sounds, so don\u2019t worry! Understanding the Importance of Third-Party App Compliance Let\u2019s imagine thatthird-party applicationsare guests at a party you\u2019re throwing. While they can add interesting and distinctive flavors to your event, there is always the worry that someone will slip and spill a drink or perhaps ruin something valuable. These \u201caccidents\u201d can translate to security flaws or data breaches in the digital realm. Here\u2019s why third-party app compliance matters: Security Risks:In the same way that you wouldn\u2019t want an accident-prone visitor at your party, your company doesn\u2019t want to introduce apps into your environment that are frequently or easily exposed to online attacks. Applications that are not compliant put your sensitive company data at risk by providing access to malware and hackers. With that access, they can easily manipulate the data and cause changes to the compliance status of the devices in your environment. Data Protection:Consider your company\u2019s data to be precious possessions in your home. Compliance regulations help you protect organizational data and guarantee that these precious possessions remain safe. They provide guidelines and create rules that apps must adhere to while handling your organization\u2019s resources and data safely. Smooth Operation:Think about when someone plays loud music at a party. It\u2019s hard to talk and have fun, right? Noncompliant apps can be like that noisy guest and can disrupt how your organization works. Compliance policies act like the host of the party, making sure everyone behaves nicely and everything goes smoothly. Setting Up Custom Device Compliance Policies in Intune and the Prerequisites Before you can begin, these are the prerequisites: Access to the Microsoft Intune portal Administrative credentials for Intune APowerShell scriptthat can detect the presence or version of third-party apps Basic knowledge of the JSON format for defining detection rules Creating the PowerShell Discovery Script To create a compliance policy, we must first develop a PowerShell script that checks for the presence and version of the third-party app you want to monitor. This script should return a specific result when the app meets the compliance criteria. Once that is created, we can then ensure the script is properly tested and functional. Example:In the script below, we are using Google Chrome as an example. The script will check for the presence of the app with the version under the registry hive: For 64-bit: HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall For 32 bits: HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432NODE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall The script will then check the DisplayName and DisplayVersion attributes. If the app is installed, it will show the name and the version. If it is not installed, it will show as \u201c0.0.0.0\u201d. Note:Make sure to enter the exact display name shown inAdd and Remove Programs. While you can use wildcards to search for software, the exact display name discovered in appwiz.cpl will be used as the setting name for the JSON compliance check rule. We will be adding a loop to convert the$appInfoarray into a single custom object named$objectJSONoutput.This is because we want a single object with all the apps and versions listed as key-value pairs in the JSON output instead of an array with separate objects for each app. In the end, we will compress the return output to a JSON file. Creating the JSON Detection Rule File Now, let\u2019s configure a JSON detection file that serves as a guide. This guide will describe the specific settings and values you want to use for device compliance with your custom compliance criteria. The JSON outlines what the discovery script will evaluate or check for on the devices. You\u2019ll need to upload the JSON file when you create a device compliance policy that includes custom compliance settings. Make sure that the JSON file has these parameters added to it and that the file is no larger than 1 megabyte (MB). SettingName: The name of the custom setting to use for base compliance. This name is case-sensitive. DataType: The type of data that you can use to build your compliance rule. For options, see the following list of supported data types:BooleanInt64DoubleStringDateTimeVersion Boolean Int64 Double String DateTime Version MoreInfoURL: This is a URL that\u2019s shown to users with noncompliant devices so they can learn more about the compliance requirement they are missing. This links to instructions that will help users bring their devices into compliance. Operand:This represents the values that the operator works on. Operator:This represents a specific action that is used to build a compliance rule. For options, see the following list of supported operators:IsEqualsNotEqualsGreaterThanGreaterEqualsLessThanLessEquals IsEquals NotEquals GreaterThan GreaterEquals LessThan LessEquals RemediationStrings: This is information that gets displayed in the Company Portal when a device is noncompliant in some way. It is intended to help users understand the remediation options to bring a device to a compliant state. There must be at least one string for the language you want to use (e.g., \u201cen_US\u201d), but you can also specify additional remediation string languages, such as:cs_CZda_DKde_DEel_GRen_USes_ESfi_FIfr_FRhu_HUit_ITja_JPko_KRnb_NOnl_NLpl_PLpt_BRro_ROru_RUsv_SEtr_TRzh_CNzh_TW cs_CZ da_DK de_DE el_GR en_US es_ES fi_FI fr_FR hu_HU it_IT ja_JP ko_KR nb_NO nl_NL pl_PL pt_BR ro_RO ru_RU sv_SE tr_TR zh_CN zh_TW For more information, seeAvailable languages for Windows. Example:In the JSON file below, we are describing the specific settings and values we\u2019ve laid out. The file outlines what the discovery script will evaluate or check for on the devices. In this scenario, it will check if Google Chrome has a version greater than or equal to 116.0.5790.110. If the version is old, mark it as having a \u201cnoncompliant\u201d status in the Intune Portal. If it is up to date, then mark it as \u201ccompliant\u201c. Assigning the Custom Device Compliance Policy Before creating the actual compliance policy, please make sure to upload the script under \u201cScripts\u201d in theCompliance policiessection. In theBasictab, add a name and description for the script. In theSettingstab, copy and paste your detection script. Keep all the other options as default. ClickNext. In theReview + Createtab, verify the settings and click onCreate. You will get a notification once the script is created. Steps to create a custom compliancepolicy for third-party applications in Intune Sign into the Microsoft Intuneadmin center. Click onDevices>Compliance Policies>Create Policy. Select \u201cWindows 10 and later\u201d as the platform for the policy. In theBasicstab, enter a name for the compliance policy settings and select the Custom Compliance setting. On theCompliance Settingstab, expand the Custom Compliance section. Select \u201cRequire\u201d on Custom Compliance. Click onSelect your discovery scriptand select the script that you created earlier as part of the prerequisites for this process. Click onUpload, validate the JSON filewith your custom compliance settings, and upload the JSON file that contains the compliance settings for third-party applications. On theActions for noncompliancetab, specify which actions that you want noncompliant devices to take. In theAssignmenttab, select the group you want to deploy the app to. Click onReview + Createto review the policy, then click onCreateto create the policy. Monitoring and Reporting On thePolicy overviewpage, you can see a summary of the policy\u2019s settings and assignments. You can check the device\u2019s actual compliance status value and see whether the device is considered compliant or noncompliant. To monitor device compliance status, look for the \u201cDevice Compliance\u201d section in Intune. Here, you\u2019ll find information about devices that are considered compliant and noncompliant with the policy. Make sure to check for all of the available compliance settings. View Compliance Reports Click on \u201cDevice Compliance\u201d to access more detailed device compliance policies and reports. You can filter and sort these reports based on various criteria, such as status only, device type, user, and more. The reports provide a comprehensive view of device compliance within your organization. Inspect Non-Compliant Devices To investigate noncompliant devices, click on the \u201cNoncompliant\u201d section of the device compliance dashboard report. You can view detailed information about each noncompliant device. In here, you can also take action to remediate and block access for noncompliant devices, such as sending notifications to users or implementing a conditional access policy to restrict access for noncompliant devices. Conclusion By keeping a close eye on the compliance status of your devices in Microsoft Intune, you\u2019re essentially staying ahead of the game. It allows you to jump on any noncompliance issues before they become big problems. Along with that, you also get to make sure that your organization\u2019s devices are playing by the rules in terms of security and how they operate. In other words, it\u2019s like having a watchful guardian to make sure your devices stay safe and follow the right path. This ongoing process of checking and reporting is the heartbeat of your device management and security efforts\u2014it\u2019s pretty much essential. It is also important to make sure that the third-party apps that you are using in your environment are up to date.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/app-blocked-by-admin/", "title": "", "raw_text": "This App Has Been Blocked by Your System Administrator A few days ago, I noticed someone facing an incredibly frustrating problem on their Windows device. They kept encountering the User Account Control error message that mentioned,\u201cThis App has been blocked by your system administrator.\u201d Every time they tried to run an application as an administrator, the error seemed to come out of nowhere, and no matter what they tried, the message would appear. To make matters worse, even attempting to right-click and \u201cRun as administrator\u201d to run the app with administrator privileges would lead to the same block. 6 Hidden Policies That Could Be Blocking Your Apps in Windows If you\u2019ve ever encountered the dreaded \u201cThis App Has Been Blocked by Your System Administrator\u201d message, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s frustrating, and tracking down the cause can feel like chasing ghosts. After a deep dive into one such case, here\u2019s what we uncovered: six potential hidden culprits, but none of them were causing the issue of obtaining administrator privileges. 1.AppLocker: AppLocker is often the first suspect in blocking apps. However, in this instance, no AppLocker policies were set, so we moved on to other possibilities. 2.Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC): Clean Slate WDAC / Appcontrol for Businesscan impose strict rules on app execution, but a thorough check revealed no active WDAC policies contributing to this block. 3.Security Baselines: Checked and Cleared We carefully reviewed all security baselines for any restrictive policies. After double-checking, there was no sign of any that could cause the block. 4.Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Only Monitoring While Microsoft Defender for Endpoint was onboarded, it was set to monitor-only mode. No policies were being enforced that could block applications from running. 5.Conditional Access & SmartScreen: Not the Issue Neither Conditional Access policies nor SmartScreen settings were configured in a way that would lead to the issue. Both were ruled out as potential blockers. 6.Shared Device Mode via Intune: The Hidden Player The real culprit turned out to be Shared Device Mode, which was quietly set through Intune. This mode is designed for shared environments (like kiosks) and restricts user permissions. In this case, it was automatically denying any attempt to run apps with admin privileges. Everything was checked and double-checked\u2014yet the error persisted. No matter what was attempted, any app that required admin privileges seemed completely blocked and showed them the same error message. At this point, it was starting to look like a ghost policy or an invisible setting was at work. That\u2019s when I started digging deeper into lesser-known configurations, and I realized there was one potential culprit still lurking in the shadows:Shared Device Modeconfigured throughIntune. This Shared PC mode, often used for environments like kiosks or multi-user machines, can contain settings that are easily overlooked but can significantly impact user permissions and app functionality. Let me show you why! The Missing Piece: Shared Device Policy After exhausting the other five options, I focused on a setting that often flies under the radar\u2014Shared Device Mode, configured viaIntune. Shared Device Mode, designed for multi-user scenarios (think: shared PCs in libraries or kiosks), contains some very restrictive default configurations that can catch you off guard if not properly understood. One particular setting stood out: the\u201cConsentPromptBehaviorUser\u201dpolicy within this Shared Device Mode. We can spot this policy and its corresponding User Account Control settings when opening the registry editor and looking at the Windows Registry. This policy, often deployed viaEnableSharedPCMode, modifies the behavior of UAC (User Account Control) security settings and prompts. Specifically, itautomatically denies elevation requestsfor standard users, essentially stripping them of the ability to right-click and \u201cRun as administrator.\u201d In environments whereAdmin Approval Modeis enabled, elevation requests for administrators must be explicitly approved by an admin. However, inShared Device Mode,Admin Approval Modeis bypassed for standard users, preventing any elevation attempts from succeeding, even if someone with administrator credentials attempts to approve the action. This leads to scenarios where users are completely blocked from running certain apps unless theShared PC Modeis disabled or adjusted. Shared PC Mode The setting \u201cConsentPromptBehaviorUser\u201d is enforced as part of the Shared PC policy and is configured toautomatically deny elevation requestsfor standard users. So, even if all other policies look clean, this one can still block users from running apps as an admin: EnableSharedPCMode: Automatically applies a GPO that denies elevation requests for standard users. ConsentPromptBehaviorUser: Ensures that no user can bypass admin controls by launching applications with elevated privileges. Once Shared PC Mode is enabled, this setting kicks in regardless of whether you\u2019ve set up other policies to manage UAC behavior. In effect, the right-click \u201cRun as administrator\u201d function is completely broken, as the elevation request is automatically denied without user interaction. With the elevation request automatically denied, we will get the famous error message that: this app has been blocked by your system administrator. Conclusion This is one of those cases where, despite no visible AppLocker, WDAC (Appcontrol for Business), or Smartscreen, Intune\u2019sShared Device Modeis quietly running the show in the background. This is why we got the message \u201cThis app has been blocked by your system administrator UAC message.\u201d If you\u2019re dealing with devices set up for multi-user scenarios, it\u2019s crucial to consider this mode and its impact on user privileges. In this case, the system administrator would need to revisit the Shared Device configuration withinIntuneand either disable the Shared PC mode or modify the policies to allow for more flexibility with administrative permissions. Remember, policies that limit administrative elevation, even if applied to standard users, can lead to widespread issues if they are not fully understood or properly documented.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/enhancing-device-security-device-attestation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows Enrollment Attestation Introduction to Device Attestation In today\u2019s world of escalating cyber threats, ensuring the security of devices within an organization is paramount. One critical technology that bolsters device security is TPM (Trusted Platform Module) attestation. But what exactly is Windows Enrollment Attestation? Windows Enrollment Attestationverifies the integrity and trustworthiness of a device\u2019s hardware and software. It uses a dedicated TPM chip, which securely stores cryptographic keys, to attest that the device is in a known good state. This process is essential for ensuring that devices have not been tampered with and are running trusted software, and it plays a crucial role in enforcing security policies. New Report Options in Intune Microsoft Intune has introduced a new report option calledDevice Attestation, which leverages TPM/MDM attestation to enhance device security. This new Intune/Windows feature allows IT administrators to generate comprehensive attestation reports, providing insights into the security posture of managed devices. These reports are crucial for organizations looking to ensure that only devices meeting strict security criteria are allowed access to corporate resources. The Device attestation status reports in Intune help administrators identify devices that have successfully completed attestation and those that have not, enabling them to take security measures. This attestation report helps prevent potential security threats. How Device Attestation Reports Work on the Device Performing Windows Enrollment Attestation and generating the corresponding report in Intune involves several steps that are seamlessly integrated into the device management workflow. Here\u2019s a detailed look at how this process works when users enroll devices into Intune: 1. Device Enrollment and Initialization When a device is enrolled in device management (Intune), the enrollment process begins with the device requesting a security token from the Intune service. This token is essential for authenticating the device using multifactor authentication and initiating the attestation process. 2. Storing Keys in TPM Once the device receives the security token, it retrieves the Intune Device Certificate. The critical step here is to store the certificate\u2019s enrollment keys, including the private key, in the TPM chip. This step, referred to asUseTPMForEnrollmentKey,ensures that the keys are securely stored, protecting them from potential tampering. 3. Initiating Attestation via Microsoft Graph Intune uses the Microsoft Graph API to initiate theTPM attestationfrom the MDM server. The specific API call,InitiateMobileDeviceManagementKeyRecovery,triggers the MDM Key Recovery and TPM attestation processes. This remote command is sent to the device, instructing it to perform the necessary attestation steps. 4. Device Recovery and Windows Enrollment Attestation Upon receiving the command, the device executes the recovery process. If the Intune Device Certificate is not already in the TPM, the device recovers it to the TPM. Following this, the device performs the MDMClientCertAttestation with Intune, completing the attestation process. 5. Generating and Viewing Windows Enrollment Attestation Reports After the device attestation is performed, the results are compiled into a comprehensive report. IT administrators can view these reports within the Intune portal, providing them with a detailed overview of the attestation status for all managed devices. The reports highlight which devices have successfully completed attestation and which have not, allowing administrators to enforce compliance policies effectively. The Windows Enrollment Attestation Flow For a clearer understanding, here is a visual representation of the TPM attestation process in Intune: Step-by-Step Breakdown: Device Enrollment:The device requests a security token and starts the enrollment process. Key Storage in TPM:Enrollment keys of the certificate are securely stored in the TPM. Initiating Attestation:Intune uses Microsoft Graph to send theInitiateMobileDeviceManagementKeyRecoverycommand. Device Recovery and Attestation:The device performs recovery and attestation, ensuring the certificate is in the TPM. The Platform Restriction Filter:This would restrict access by preventing unattested devices from getting enrolled. Report Generation:Intune generates attestation reports, viewable by IT administrators. Let\u2019s see how creating a new platform enrollment restriction can further secure enrollment. Securing Windows Enrollment with IsTpmAttested With the MDM Certificate hardened and attested, ensuring that only devices that successfully performed TPM attestation can enroll in Intune is essential. To achieve this, you can create a Windows device platform restriction policy within Intune to block non-attested devices from enrolling. Creating the Restriction Policy To enforce this policy, follow these steps: Create a New Filter: (device.IsTpmAttested -eq \u201cFalse\u201d) This filter checks whether the device has successfully performed TPM attestation. Assign the Policy:Assign the new device restriction policy to all users and include the filter. Assign the Policy:Assign the new device restriction policy to all users and include the filter. This filter checks whether the device has successfully performed TPM attestation. Enforcing the Policy With this filter in place, devices that did not successfully perform TPM attestation will be blocked from enrolling. When the device is blocked from enrollment, the error80180032will appear. This additional security measure ensures that only trusted devices are managed by Intune, which is especially important for organizations with a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. If an enrollment attempt fails due to this policy, the device will display an error message indicating that it cannot be enrolled. For instance, a virtual machine that cannot perform TPM attestation will show an error code80180032, signaling that enrollment is blocked. Benefits of this Policy for Security Measures Implementing this device platform restriction policy enhances the security of your MDM environment by ensuring that only devices meeting strict security criteria are enrolled. It helps prevent potential security breaches caused by non-attested devices and restricts access to unnecessary features. Conclusion Windows Enrollment Attestation is a powerful mechanism for ensuring the integrity and security of devices within an organization. With Intune\u2019s new attestation report feature, administrators now have a robust tool to verify device security and enforce compliance policies. By following the steps outlined in this blog, organizations can significantly enhance their device security posture, ensuring that only trusted and attested devices are allowed access to corporate resources. Stay ahead in the security game by leveraging TPM attestation and Intune\u2019s comprehensive reporting capabilities. These cutting-edge technologies will secure your digital environment and protect your organization from potential threats.

Instead of relying on this process, what if I tell you that we can disable it andlaunch the Company Portal automatically at first login? This ensures users can see app installation progress and compliance status immediately without delays or getting stuck at the Enrollment Status Page. The best thing? This isn\u2019t limited to the Company Portal. Any app can be launched in the same way. Here\u2019s how to do it. Introduction At Ignite 2024,Microsoft announced the automatic startup feature for thenew Company Portal UI, a potential big improvement forAutopilot Device Preparation(AP-DPP). This feature could significantly enhance the user onboarding experience! By skipping the traditional Enrollment Status Page (ESP) and launching the Company Portal automatically, users get clear app installation and compliance updates instead of getting stuck at \u201cAccount setup\u201d and \u201cIdentifying\u201d during Autopilot enrollment. How the New Company Portal Could Enhance Onboarding The\u201crevamped\u201d Company Portal UIimproves how users interact with app installations and compliance checks. Instead of waiting for the traditional ESP to complete its phases (which, let\u2019s be honest, can cause a lot of issues), users could be greeted with a more dynamic interface that provides real-time feedback. By configuring the Autopilot Enrollment flow to rely on theCompany Portal, you\u2019re giving users a better experience: Clear and transparent:Your users can see the installed appsand track theirprogress of they are still installing. Efficient and Informative:Compliance checks and device readiness are communicated directly. Intuitive:Users are asked to take action if necessary, reducing IT support queries. Integrating the Company Portal into your onboarding strategy enhances efficiency and improves the user experience.Since this functionality is not yet available, here\u2019s how to implement it yourself! Automatically start of the Company Portal As mentioned above, Microsoft announced this feature at Ignite,but it\u2019s not available yet. While the feature is still in development, let\u2019s explore how to enable it ourselves! To do so, we need to start by ensuring that the user status page (for APv1) will be skipped! Skipping the User Status Page (APv1 Only) The first step in automatically starting up the Company Portal after login is skipping the User Status Page unless you useAutopilot Device Preparation (AP-DPP). With AP-DPP, the account setup phase is already skipped, which pretty much confirms Microsoft\u2019s intent to phase out the user status page (Account Phase) entirely. By configuring a CSP to disable this step (SkipUserStatusPage), you allow the Company Portal to handle app and compliance statuses. This approach streamlines the flow and ensures a smoother user experience. OMA-URI./Device/Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/FirstSyncStatus/SkipUserStatusPage ChooseBooleanas Data type ChooseTrueas Value Just to clarify: We\u2019reNOTskipping the Device ESP here, only the User ESP (which, let\u2019s be honest, is broken half the time anyway). This ensures that all your Autopilot-required and device-targeted apps, like Office, VPN tools, and more, are still properly installed on the device as expected. Once theSkipUserStatusPagesetting is configured, it will be applied to the device and recorded in theFirstSyncregistry key. That\u2019s a key detail we\u2019ve touched on before, right? If not, you\u2019ll want to check outthis blog, it dives deep into how the ESP evaluates and progresses through its phases. WithSkipUserStatusPageconfigured, the next step is to ensure the Company Portal launches automatically on the first login. But how do we make that happen for APv1 and APv2??? Configuring the Automatic Startup of the Company Portal Here\u2019s the catch: there\u2019s still no built-in feature to automatically startup the Company Portal automatically after the first boot (even though it was announced at Ignite, it\u2019s not here yet). That\u2019s where a little customization comes in. By configuring the Company Portal as a Line of Business (LOB) app in the device context and using a PowerShell script, you can auto-launch it after login. Let\u2019s start by adding the Company Portal app to Intune Download the LOB versionof the Company Portal. Deploy it through Intune and assign itto devices,and ensure the Install Context is set to:Device Context Ensure the app is included in your Autopilot APv1 profile as a required app or the Autopilot Device Preparation Profile if you\u2019re using APv2 Once configured, I also needed to ensure that the Company Portal app would be automatically launched when the user logs in to Windows\u2014and only once! To do so, I needed a PowerShell script (works for APv1 and Apv2) This PowerShell script performs the following tasks: Creates a Scripts Directory:Ensures theC:Scriptsfolder exists, creating it if necessary. Defines a PowerShell Script:Creates a script namedLaunchCompanyPortal.ps1in theC:Scriptsfolder. This script: Checks a specific registry key (HKCU:Software\\CompanyPortalLauncher) to see if the Company Portal app has already been launched for the current user. Launches the Company Portal app (companyportal:) if the registry flag does not exist or indicates it hasn\u2019t been launched yet. Sets a registry flag to record that the app has been launched for the user. Creates a Startup Shortcut:Adds a shortcut namedLaunchCompanyPortal.lnkto the All Users Startup folder (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\WindowsStart Menu\\Programs\\StartUp). The shortcut: Executes theLaunchCompanyPortal.ps1script silently during user login using PowerShell with cmd.exe /c /start /min Logs Success or Errors:Provides feedback during each step of the process (script creation, registry flag setting, shortcut creation), outputting messages to the console for troubleshooting. Automates Company Portal Launch:This ensures that the Company Portal app automatically launches during startup only if it hasn\u2019t been launched for the current user before. It is obvious we still need to configure/upload the script, so let\u2019s do so! I uploaded the PowerShell script to Intune, which you will find below, and ensured it would run in the system context. Also, please ensure you assign it to the proper device group. So, for Autopilot Device Preparation, this is the Enrollment Time group you also configured in the AP-DPP Profile. If you are using AP-DPP, you also need to ensure that after uploading and assigning the script, it is also added to the AP-DPP Profile as an allowed script. (otherwise, it won\u2019t be executed during AP-DPP) The Startup Delay issue With the prerequisites configured, the next step is to ensure theCompany Portal launches immediately upon first login. Initially, the PowerShell script placed a shortcut in the Startup folder, whichworked, but not as expected. Instead of launchinginstantly, there was a frustrating60\u201390 second delay. At first, I thought:\u201cWhat\u2019s causing this lag? The shortcut is in the right place, so why isn\u2019t the Company Portal opening the moment the desktop loads?\u201dThis led me to dig deeper intoWindows startup behavior. By default,Windows 11 staggers the launch of startup applicationsto optimize system performance. This process is controlled by theWaitForIdleStateregistry setting, which delays startup tasks until Windows considers the system to be idle. While this helps prevent system overload during login, itunnecessarily holds back the Company Portal from launching when users need it most. To force an immediate launch, we need toadjust a registry keythat controls startup delays. Ensures the Registry Key Exists:Creates theSerializeregistry key underExplorerif it doesn\u2019t already exist. Disables Startup Delay:SetsWaitForIdleStateto0, preventing startup delays for scripts and apps. Optional Delay Reduction:SetsStartupDelayInMSecto0for an even faster launch. With this tweak, theCompany Portal now launches almost instantlyafter login, no more unnecessary waiting! The Results I decided to record it and showcase the results\u2014it\u2019s much easier than trying to explain how it works! https://youtu.be/z7275tjqvc8 And the funny thing about this solution? We can also use the same approach for other processes that need to be executed when the user logs in to the device for the first time! The Summary In summary, here\u2019s what needs to be done to ensure the Company Portal launches automatically after enrollment If you are using Autopilot V1, You need to configure the SkipUserStatusPage setting You need to ensure you upload the MSI You need to Upload Both PowerShell Scripts (AutoStart and Fix Delay) If you are using Autopilot Device Preparation You need to ensure you upload the MSI and assign it to the enrollment time group You need to Upload Both PowerShell Scripts (AutoStart and Fix Delay) Assign both the PowerShell scripts and the MSI app to the AP-DPP Profile as allowed apps and PowerShell scripts Wrapping It Up By addressing the startup delay and automating the launch of the Company Portal, you can ensure users have instant access to app statuses and compliance updates right after logging in.

As we grew, we knew that building and fostering connections across time zones and continents would require more than just good tools; it would require intention. This need for intention is no surprise: people build trust more easily and organically in person. While remote work has many perks, it also challenges the way humans form connections and relationships. That\u2019s why, even as a fully remote company, we deliberately make space for in-person connection. In-person interactions fuel empathy, build rapport faster, boost team performance, and strengthen collaboration. As McKinsey & Company puts it: \u201cOrganizations that invest in in-person connection \u2013 even in a hybrid world \u2013 outperform peers in culture strength, innovation, and team resilience.\u201d So what\u2019s a fully remote company, with130 full-time team membersspread across 13 countries, to do? Enter: The Patch My PC 2025 Summit! Being fully remote is a superpower \u2013 it allows us to build a team of people with unique backgrounds and perspectives from around the globe. It also makes the moments wedogather in person even more significant. Our first all-company retreat took place in early 2023 when we had 62 team members. That gathering proved so valuable, we brought everyone together again the following year. In 2023, we focused onour origin story; a vital piece of understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind what we do today. Most importantly, we introduced our purpose \u2013Improving Lives, Through Customer-Obsessed Innovation; the driving force behind everything we do at Patch My PC. In 2024, our focus shifted to the future: our product roadmap, innovation goals, and the introduction of ourBig Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG)\u2013 the north star guiding our growth. When planning the 2025 retreat, we intentionally shifted our content strategy to reflect where we are as a company and where we are going, with our BHAG andcore valuesas the anchor. One team member shared a bold idea: instead of calling our meet-up a \u201cretreat,\u201d why not call it a \u201csummit\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t \u201cRetreat\u201d \u2013 weAdvance.With humility\u2026We take the high ground, We win the lawsuit, We outthink, outbuild, We overcome challenges, We strive forward, We climb. We Summit.\u201d \u2013 Trevor Thompson We loved it. This mindset captured exactly what this moment in our company\u2019s journey calls for. Thus, the Patch My PC Retreat officially became the Patch My PC Summit. Designing the 2025 Summit As we planned, our leadership team reflected deeply on the value of genuine, face-to-face connections. What kind of experiences did we want to create? What does the team need right now to keep advancing? What messages need to be communicated company-wide for the vision and purpose to continue to thrive? Patch My PC is rapidly growing, and we wanted to prepare our team for the changes and adaptations we need to make as a company to propel us forward. Change is something to be excited about, but only when thewhyis clear. We knew that we needed to provide our team with the context, tools, and connections necessary to embrace and drive that change. We shaped the week around five core themes: Celebration\u2013 honoring our team\u2019s hard work and wins from 2024 Creativity\u2013 building innovative products and features Change\u2013 growing through adaptation Cultivation\u2013 sharpening skills and building capabilities through focused learning Culture\u2013 staying rooted inour core valueswhile evolving how we work together We structured the week to be valuable not just for setting our yearly vision, but also for providing our team with numerous opportunities to connect, both within functional areas and across them. This included a dedicated functional team day, where teams came together in person to collaborate and plan for the year ahead. A highlight of our Cultivation focus was ourPatch Academy.We dedicated two full days to learning, with team member-led sessions across three track levels. Courses focused on everything from diving into technical product knowledge, market insights, and future-facing development themes. We also made time for fun, relationship-building moments across the company: Raft-building race Lego team challenge Functional and company-wide dinners Morning workouts on the beach The now-legendary Patch My PC karaoke party Excursions in the style of \u201cpick-your-own-adventure\u201d to explore Costa Rica in your own way Giving Back Staying true toour values, we also wanted to give back to the local community. We partnered with a nearby school to assemble and donate backpacks filled with essential school supplies for children in need. Our team collected school supplies donated personally and through their local communities with team member led drives. In total we were able to donate 150 filled backpacks! The Power of In-Person Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, said it well: \u201cInnovation isn\u2019t always a planned activity. It happens when people run into each other, look each other in the eye, and have the courage to challenge and inspire.\u201d And as one of our own team members shared in our post-summit survey: \u201cWe came up with lots of ideas/tasks/innovations that could cater to our Q2 goals and beyond. This was especially valuable as team members were able to explain why something mattered to them and how it could have a positive effect on PMPC.\u201d Across all industries and leadership philosophies, one message is clear: in-person connection builds the foundation for faster trust, deeper creativity, and stronger culture. At Patch My PC,our values\u2013 delivering excellence, showing empathy, creating experiences, serving others, avoiding shenanigans, being humble, and thinking big \u2013 thrive when we come together. Our Summit isn\u2019t just an event. It\u2019s an investment in our people, our culture, and our future.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/web-sign-in-tap-missing-after-autopilot-pre-provisioning/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The Case of the Disappearing Web Sign-in After Autopilot Pre-provisioning This blog will show you a strange issue we encountered after deploying some Windows 11 devices using Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployments (White-Glove). The user signed in using a Temporary Access Pass with Web Sign-in. After getting logged out unexpectedly, the option to use Web Sign-in (TAP) simply wasn\u2019t there anymore. When Everything Seemed to Work It all started with a pretty standard Autopilot setup. We had a bunch of Windows 11 24h2 devices going through Autopilot pre-provisioning, which is nothing unusual. The devices were enrolled, apps were installed, and all the required policies were applied. Once everything finished successfully, the device was sealed, and handed off to users. The idea was pretty simple: Turn it on, sign in with a Temporary Access Pass (TAP), and start working. First, some background information about TAP. Temporary Access Pass, or TAP, is a one-time passcode that can be used to sign in without knowing the actual password. It\u2019s limited by time and usage and is usually handed out during onboarding. TAP is extremely useful when rolling out passwordless authentication or setting up Windows Hello for Business. If the user has never signed in before and doesn\u2019t know their credentials yet, TAP makes everything easier and more secure. The First Web-Sign in\u2026 and Then It Breaks After resealing the device, the user turns it on and is greeted by the Windows sign-in screen. They select Sign-in options, choose Web Sign-in, and are redirected to the familiar Microsoft login page. They type in their Temporary Access Pass and authenticate successfully, and the login seems to work, until it just disappears. Right after signing in, the session logs out. There is no message or an option to configure Windows Hello for Business, just a flash and a return to the sign-in screen. When the user needs to click the Sign-in option again, the Web Sign-in option is no longer available. As shown above, the only two options available are the same: username and password. The option to use the web sign-in to use TAP was completely missing, and since the user did not have a password, they were not able to log in. So, what happened with the web sign for Windows option? The Web-Sign in Account That Isn\u2019t Really an Account Digging into the device with a remote background tool, we noticed that at least something had happened. The user had technically signed in, at least partially. But it wasn\u2019t a full Azure AD /Entra or local account. It was the web account, a temporary session built by the Web Account Manager. More specifically, it was theWSIAccount. The WSIAccount, or Web Sign-In account, is created during the Web Sign-in flow and exists only as long as it needs to (disabled by default). It\u2019s a minimal context that uses token-based authentication to let the user in, complete the first sign-in, and start things like Windows Hello setup. But it\u2019s fragile. It doesn\u2019t create a full user profile and doesn\u2019t persist beyond that initial use case. And if something interrupts that short session, like a forced logoff, the system ends up in a half-signed state. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. Because the WSIAccount was incomplete, the system believed a user was already present but didn\u2019t allow the same flow again. Web Sign-in was removed from the list of options. The strange part is that if you sign in with an additional local user account and then sign out again, Web Sign-in suddenly reappears. With it, the WSIccount broken session is cleared, and the web provider is allowed again. The Real Trigger: DeviceLock We noticed that after using the TAP/Web sign-in option, the user should normally be redirected to Windows Hello for the business pin setup flow, but instead, the user was now logged out. It\u2019s almost as if the device rebooted, but it just logged out this time. Having your devices reboot during Autopilot is a pretty well-known issue. Windows Autopilot troubleshooting FAQ | Microsoft Learn I had the feeling that the policy causing the device to reboot could also cause the user to be logged out after signing in using the web sign-in. After ruling out all the other policies, the web sign-in culprit was indeed caused by a specific configuration profile that applied aDeviceLock setting. The policy in question was intended to enhance security by enforcing a reboot after ten incorrect password attempts, with the idea that BitLocker would then require its PIN. But the setting used for this, MaxPasswordFailuresBeforeWipe, is backed by the DeviceLock CSP. The problem is that this CSP has a side effect. When the policy is targeted to a device group, it can somehow force an immediate logoff or even trigger a reboot. And yes, Microsoft even lists this behavior in its FAQ documentation. So, right after the TAP login, the device quietly reacts to that policy and logs the user out before the session is fully established. Compliance Policies also breaking Web Sign-in What makes this even funnier is that compliance policies can also invoke the same DeviceLock CSP, especially those based on Exchange ActiveSync (EAS). If those compliance policies are assigned to the device rather than the user, they may behave in exactly the same way. Normally, compliance policies only check if the device is compliant, but this Password Compliance policy would also enforce the device lock policy! The result? No Windows Web Sign-in, no working profile, and no way to use TAP again. The Fix: Timing and Scope After confirming the cause, we removed the password policy that caused the web sign to dissapear. After reenrolling the device again, the issue was indeed fixed. Web Sign-in stayed available after the first reboot. TAP worked as expected. Alternatively, when dealing with these policies that could break the web sign-in, changing the assignment from device to user also helps prevent this web sign-in issue! Final Thoughts In the end, it was just a password policy that applied at exactly the wrong time. The DeviceLock CSP policy did what it was supposed to do, but it broke the web sign-in flow without any warning. If you\u2019re using Autopilot with pre-provisioning and TAP, double-check any policy that touches DeviceLock, whether it\u2019s a device configuration policy or a compliance policy using EAS. One setting is all it takes to kill Web Sign-in right when you need it most.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/when-region-settings-break-microsoft-store-apps-in-autopilot-0x87d30017/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Microsoft Store Apps Failing During Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) with 0x87D30017? Company Portal failing duringAutopilot Device Preparation(AP-DP)with0x87D30017? It might be your region settings. This blog will focus on how specific region settings could prevent the Company Portal from being installed from the Microsoft Store. Introduction In most Windows Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) deployments, theCompany Portalapp is set as an allowed application. The moment the app is configured as an allowed app, it is required to be installed during enrollment. By assigning the Company Portal in the system context, we ensure it isinstalled during the device setupphase, before the user even logs in. The goal is simple: have the Company Portal installed and ready the moment the user reaches the desktop. This flow improves user onboarding, reduces unnecessary support tickets, and provides users with a clear view of the device\u2019s status. The same logic applies to Autopilot V1. If we really want to improve that user onboarding experience as well, we need to configure the Company Portal tolaunch automatically after Autopilot completes. If it launches automatically after enrollment, the user doesn\u2019t have to search for it. Everything is fine until the enrolling user tells the device that it is located in a region like Lebanon. The user starts enrolling the Device. The user powers on the device and selects Lebanon as the country or region At that point, thehome locationis set toGEOID 139, and things start to quietly fall apart. As shown below, when deploying the Company Portal in the system context and requiring it as a Microsoft Store app during AP-DP, the device hits a blocking condition. The user ends up stuck on a screen that says it cannot complete device setup. The Company Portal App fails to install. And because it\u2019s a blocking app, the Autopilot Device Preparation process fails completely. Let me show you why. Company Portal Not Detected: 0x87D30017 The moment the device starts provisioning, the ESP kicks in, and everything appears to be fine\u2026 until it doesn\u2019t. Your Autopilot (Device Preparation) enrollment will fail, and when you look at the Logs, you will notice the Detection Error-201625017everywhere. When you open the Intune portal to check the Company Portal App installation state on the device, we notice that we receive the0x87D30017\u2013 Package not found error. So, how to continue? Well.. that\u2019s where I come in. The Root Cause of the errors: 201625017 and 0x87D30017 The store app issue lies in how the Microsoft Store handles app availability. Microsoft\u2019s backend filters which apps are available based on the device\u2019s region. That logic is enforced not only in the Store UI, but also in the backend APIs used by Winget and the Intune Management Extension. Winget/Intune Management Extension both rely on the same DLL: Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller.dll PackageManager.dll Under the hood, they all query the same URL: storeedgefd.dsx.mp.microsoft.com, and those queries include region-specific metadata in the headers. If the device is set to Lebanon, the region keyword LB is included. That\u2019s enough to filter out the Company Portal Store app. With the Company Portal app not available, your Autopilot Enrollment will fail with the error0x87D30017! Change the region to Netherlands, rerun the exact same query, and the Company Portal shows up in the response. The region keyword is the only difference. Shall we zoom in on the Root Cause details and how I confirmed the story above? Confirming the 0x87D30017 issue with Winget We didn\u2019t stop at the error code0x87D30017.To confirm what was happening, we ran several tests using Winget, the Microsoft Store app, Fiddler, and verbose logging. Using winget search \u201cCompany Portal\u201d -source msstore-verbose-logs. We tested devices with different region settings. When the region was set to Lebanon, the Company Portal simply wasn\u2019t returned when performing the winget search for the company portal. No results\u2026 No package found matching input criteria. We repeated the same search after switching the region to the Netherlands, and there it was. Since Winget did not show any results when the location/region was set to Lebanon, I was curious what Fiddler could show me. Digging into the \u201cNo Package Found\u201d Error So I configured Fiddler (check out myPatch-N-Rant sessionon how to set it up and to configure it). To ensure I could capture the Microsoft Store Traffic, I also added an additional registry key to disable the Certificate Pinning for the Microsoft Store/ Desktop App installer. After everything was set up, I opened Fiddler, and when I executed the same winget search command, we could clearly see the backend request tohttps://storeedgefd.dsx.mp.microsoft.com/v9.0/manifestSearch. The moment use winget to search for the Company Portal, Winget (and also the WinStore.App) will try to find the GEO location of the device. Once winget or the store app finds the proper region, it will try to reach out to thestoreedgefd.dsx.microsoft.comURL and will pass that GEO location (KeyWord/Platform) in the headers. We can spot this same behavior in the WindowsPackageManager.dll as shown below. The only difference between the Microsoft Store and Winget was the presence of the region, which was passed via the \u201cKeyword\u201d or \u201cmarket\u201d field in the payload. If you open the WinGet Logs from the DiagOutputDir, you will notice the same behavior. After noticing the KeyWord in the WinGet logs, I switched to Fiddler itself. Tracing the Failure in Fiddler When set to LB, the backend returned a filtered result with no Company Portal being mentioned in the Fiddler Response. When set to NL, the full manifest, including Company Portal, was returned in the response. We repeated the same test using the Microsoft Store app itself. When switching the device region to Lebanon via Settings, the Store app prompted us to restart it to finish our change to the region or language. This was a strong indicator that something region-specific was being applied internally. After reopening the Store, it became clear that the Microsoft Store was no longer showing the Company Portal app as an available app. At the same moment we searched for the Company Portal App, we also had Fiddler up and running. We noticed that it made the exact same request to the same endpoint (storeedgefd.dsx.mp.microsoft.com) again, including the region in the headers payload. This proves that Winget, the Store app, and IME all depend on the same backend and are affected by the same filtering logic. If the app is excluded in a region, it doesn\u2019t matter which tool you use it won\u2019t show up. Validating Company Portal Availability Across Regions After confirming that region filtering was blocking the Company Portal in Lebanon, we wanted to determine the extent of the issue. To do that, Kevin (the one who approached me with the issue) created a script that loops through all known GEOIDs and checks if the Company Portal is available via Winget. It quickly highlights in which countries the app can or cannot be found when using the Microsoft Store backend. You can find the script here:Detect-CompanyPortalAvailability.ps1 on GitHub This approach helps identify region-specific gaps in advance, so you don\u2019t have to wait for Autopilot to fail before discovering that the Company Portal isn\u2019t available. Why AP-DP Fails with 0x87D30017 I guess this is pretty simple, but if the required Microsoft Store app isn\u2019t available, IME has nothing to install. The detection will fail and it throws0x87D30017. The ESP waits, retries, and eventually fails. That alone is enough to break the Autopilot experience. It gets worse. Even if the region is temporarily changed to something supported and the app installs, switching the region back to Lebanon can trigger IME to fail app revalidation. It checks for the app again using the same Store logic, and the app is once again invisible. The result? Intune reports the app as failed, even though it\u2019s installed and working. And if Autopilot is still waiting on ESP, that\u2019s enough to stall provisioning. Workarounds to avoid the 0x87D30017 error Option 1: Use the Offline or Win32 Version The cleanest solution is to stop relying on the Microsoft Store version of the Company Portal altogether, at least for the required Autopilot Apps, if you are based in a location that doesn\u2019t have access to the company portal. Use the offline MSIX package or repackage it as a Win32 app and deploy it through Intune. This bypasses all the region-based filtering logic in the Store backend. For everything beyond the Company Portal,Patch My PC isthe tool you\u2019ll want in place. Option 2: Switch to the User install Behavior? Instead of using the system install behavior for the company portal app, we can switch back to User install behavior By switching it to User install behavior (or removing it as a required app during enrollment), the Company Portal will be installed later on (which will fail eventually), but with it, your Autopilot enrollment itself wouldn\u2019t fail. Option 3: Add a Remediation to Handle Region Switching If you still want to use the Store-based version, build a remediation script that: Checks the current region (get-winhomelocation) Tries to run winget search \u201cCompany Portal\u201d If no results are returned and region is LB: Temporarily sets the region to NL or US Installs the app with Winget Reverts the region back after installation This allows you to force installation during Autopilot even when the Store backend would normally block it based on region. Microsoft Mentions It, But Lightly Microsoft does hint at this in theirdocumentation: \u201cIf you assign an app to a device that is located in a region where that app is not supported, the app will not install on the device. However, if the device is moved to a region that supports the app, the app will install on the device.\u201d That\u2019s about all they say. There\u2019s no list. No matrix. No documentation is available on which apps are available where. You can only find out by testing in that region or waiting for your Autopilot flow to fail. And that\u2019s the real issue here. We need visibility. A public list of Store apps and their supported regions would go a long way in helping administrators avoid silent failures like this. Final Thoughts The0x87D30017error isn\u2019t caused by Winget or IME but by region-aware filtering quietly enforced by the Microsoft Store backend. If you rely on Microsoft Store Winget apps during Autopilot, you need to test per region or avoid the Store entirely until Microsoft provides more transparency. Company Portal might not be available through Patch My PC, but it\u2019s a good reminder that for managing all your other apps reliably and without regional surprises, Patch My PC is the tool you want in place.Book a demoif you want to hear more!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/migrating-from-office-365-connectors/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Migrating from Office 365 Connectors to the Workflows App for Webhook Notifications in Microsoft Teams Since Microsoft recently announced that Office 365 Connectors were being retired in Microsoft Teams, many admins have wondered how they will facilitate webhook notifications in Teams channels. In this post, we will show you how to migrate your notifications from Office 365 connectors to the Workflows app for webhook notifications in Microsoft Teams. Retirement of Office 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams The developer blog recommends that customers now utilize \u201cPower Automate workflows as the solution to relay information into and out of Teams in a scalable, flexible, and secure way.\u201d What are the timelines for the retirement of the Office 365 Connectors? August 15th, 2024is when Microsoft first announced they would be retiring the Office 365 connectors feature from Microsoft Teams. This announcement, onJuly 3rd, 2024was met with instant backlash from the community. Some customers have hundreds of webhook connectors set up for notifications. Examples range from platforms such as Azure DevOps for build and release notifications and work item changes, Azure Monitor for resource monitoring, and GitHub actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Migrating from using Office 365 connectors to another solution, over the summer, when staff were on vacation, was a ludicrous proposal. Ok, it wasn\u2019t \u201cAll\u201d that bad. The earlier date given was when customers could no longercreatenew Office 365 connectors. Microsoft had planned to retire the service in waves:- Wave 1 \u2013 effective August 15th, 2024:All new Connector creation will be blocked within all clouds Wave 1 \u2013 effective August 15th, 2024:All new Connector creation will be blocked within all clouds Wave 2 \u2013 effective October 1st, 2024:All connectors within all clouds will stop working Wave 2 \u2013 effective October 1st, 2024:All connectors within all clouds will stop working Communication Update 23rd July 2024 Microsoft extended the retirement timeline through December 2025 to provide ample time to migrate to a different solution, such as Workflows (Power Automate) or Microsoft Graph. Microsoft touted that all existing connectors within all clouds would now continue to work untilDecember 2025, however using connectors beyondDecember 31, 2024would require additional action:- \u201cConnector owners will be required to update the respective URL to post by December 31st, 2024. At least 90 days prior to the December 31, 2024 deadline, we will send further guidance about making this URL update. If the URL is not updated by December 31, 2024 the connector will stop working. This is due to further service hardening updates being implemented for Office 365 connectors in alignment with Microsoft\u2019sSecure Future Initiative. Starting August 15th, 2024 allnewcreations should be created using the Workflows app in Microsoft Teams\u201d The verbiage doesn\u2019t specifically suggest that you can\u2019t create Office 365 Connectors starting August 15th, 2024; instead, it suggests that you start using the Workflows app instead. It\u2019s safe to assume that we will have to replace all our existing Office 365 connectors by the end of the year. So, as we sip cocktails beside the pool this summer, we should start planning that work now. Workflows App Licensing Workflows in Microsoft Teams are by far the easiest way to create a new webhook URL for a Teams channel. The main difference with Workflows is that the workflow will be owned by the user creating it. The user creating a workflow must be licensed to use Office 365. Specifically, the following SKUs license them to use Cloud Workflows. Cloud Workflows are included with:- Office 365 E1 Office 365 E1 Office 365 E3 Office 365 E3 Office 365 E5 Office 365 E5 Office 365 F3 Office 365 F3 More specifically, Webhook notifications in Microsoft Teams, created via the Workflows app, are considered Standard Connectors and fall within the licenses mentioned above. Create a Webhook URL in a Teams Channel to receive Webhook Notifications Webhook notification URLs can be generated via the Workflows app within Microsoft Teams or from Power Automate. It is much simpler to generate them from the Workflows app, but we will show both methods. Workflows App Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to the Channel where you want to receive Webhook Notifications.

Example of how to send an Adaptive Card Teams channel message using PowerShell You simply need the webhook URL generated when you created the Workflow. Then, you can use a simple Invoke-Rest Method command from PowerShell to send notifications to the Teams channel. Here is an example of the code used to generate the notification displayed in this image. Workflow Nuances Unlike Office 365 Connectors, the notification posted in the Teams Channel will contain the name of the person who created the flow. Remember, the flow is owned by the user who created it. The flow is posted in the Teams Channel by the flow Bot on behalf of the user. If you do not want the name of the user displayed on the notification, you could create an account solely for the purpose of posting notifications and name it \u201cCompany Notification Bot\u201d. You would need to ensure this account is a member of the Teams the notification will be posted in and also is licensed as mentioned at the beginning of this post. Summary The Workflows app in Microsoft Teams is a built-in feature designed to create custom workflows directly within the Teams application. This app can be particularly useful for straightforward tasks like posting notifications to a channel when certain triggers are met. The app is pretty neat and offers a very low bar of entry for folks to begin using Power Automate and flows. The workflows created by the templates are also accessible fromhttps://make.powerautomate.comwhere users can edit the flows and perform more complex tasks. It\u2019s frustrating that customers were given short notice of the deprecation of Office 365 Connectors. The deadline was pushed back until the end of 2024 before existing Office 365 connectors would cease to function. Workflows offers a nice alternative to posting notifications to Channels in Teams, but some users may not like the fact that the user who created the flow will be visually displayed on the notification. NOTEThe workflows app is currently supported in bothPatch My PC CloudandPatch My PC Publisher version 2.1.27.0or higher.

This will allow users to more quickly import large catalogs containing few new updates. Inclusion of signing certificates within updates catalogs\u2013 Catalog producers can now include signing certificates with their updates catalogs. This enables users to add the certificates to the trusted publishers list during import so that approval prompts will not block publish operations. Signature Timestamp \u2013Updates published to a WSUS server will by default have the signature time-stamped. Note, this functionality requires internet access. If you have upgraded from preview 1 this will not be automatically enabled.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/personal-data-encryption/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Personal Data Encryption: Secure Your Personal Files, the Right Way At Ignite 2024, Microsoft (re)introduced some exciting security features for Windows 11, includingLocal Administrator ProtectionandWindows 11 Hotpatchingand Personal Data Encryption. We already wrote some stuff about two of them, so why not dive intoPersonal Data Encryption (PDE)next? PDE is a shiny new Windows feature designed to protect your personal files by tying encryption directly to your user session. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore how it works, how to set it up, and test real-world scenarios like SYSTEM and administrator access to see just how secure it really is. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to keep your files safe, even from elevated accounts, this is the blog for you! Introduction If you\u2019ve ever been concerned about someone gaining access to your files, whether it\u2019s another user on your device or even a local administrator,Microsoft\u2019s Personal Data Encryption (PDE)is here to help. PDE protects your files by tying encryption directly to your user session, making them completely inaccessible to anyone else on your device, even users with admin privileges. The core purpose of Personal Data Encryption (PDE) is to prevent other users (local administrators), from accessing a user its personal data on the device. Normally, a local administrator could access all personal user data, but with PDE, those files become inaccessible to anyone without the user\u2019s credentials. This blog will explain how PDE works, how to set it up, and how it performs under different conditions. We\u2019ll test it against various scenarios and uncover some interesting details about how encryption behaves by looking at some funny DLLs 1. What Is Personal Data Encryption (PDE)? Personal Data Encryption (PDE)is a Windows feature designed to keep your files safe from unauthorized access. It protects files by encrypting them in a way that: Only youcan access the files while you are logged in. If you log out, the encryption keys are erased, and no one, including SYSTEM or other administrators, can decrypt the files. Windows Hellofor Business is required, so signing in with your PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition ensures the encryption keys are unlocked. Why Is Personal Data Encryption (PDE) Different? Unlike traditional encryption systems likeEncrypting File System (EFS), PDE does not rely on certificates or recovery agents. Instead, it depends on your current user session and your Windows Hello credentials. Once you log off, the encryption keys are gone, and the files stay locked. With the files being locked, no other user (administrators) has access to it ! 2. Requirements Before using PDE, ensure the following are set up on your system: Windows 11: PDE is available on newer versions of Windows 11 (22h2 and up). Windows Hello for Business: You must use Windows Hello (PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition) to enable encryption keys for your session.(Security keys such as Fido aren\u2019t supported) Entra Joined: Devices needs to be Entra joined. Hybrid is not supported Folders to Protect: PDE allows encryption of the known (onedrive)folders, such as your Desktop or Documents. Enterprise:PDE doen\u2019t work on Windows Pro\u2026 You will need Education or Enterprise to activate it.. Which is weird if you ask me, as it feels like a pro feature also Disable Winlogon automatic restart sign-on(ARSO) 3. How to Set Up Personal Data Encryption Using Intune Configuring Personal Data Encryption in Intune is pretty simple. To configure PDE, we only need to configure a new disk encryption policy. Step 1: Create a Configuration Profile Open the Intune portal and go toEndpoint Security > Disk Encryption Create a new configuration profile and selectPersonal Data Encryption Step 2: Configure the Personal Data Encryption Settings In the configuration profile: Enable PDE encryption: Set the feature toEnablemode to enforce session-based personal data encryption. Specify the known folders to encrypt: Ensure the Pictures/Documents and Desktop folder are enabled for PDE. Step 3: Assign and Apply Assign the profile to the appropriate user or device group. Once the policy is applied, users will see files in specified folders automatically encrypted with a lock icon.(more in this later on) Step 4: Ensure OneDrive KFM Is Active (optional) OneDrive isn\u2019t a hard requirement for Personal Data Encryption, but having a backup is strongly recommended to protect against key loss. If the encryption keys are lost, access to protected files may be permanently gone. So, ensure you configured the silently move Windows Known folders to OneDrive. Step 5: Ensure Winlogon automatic restart sign-on (ARSO) is Disabled One of the requirements for PDE to protect our personal data is to ensure ARSO is disabled. If ARSO is not disabled, the system falls back to Data Protection API (DPAPI) mode. With it, the data will be accessible when the user logs in with their Password. The funny thing? This policy is enabled by default So, if you are creating the PDE policy, don\u2019t forget to also configure the Winlogon automatic restart sign-on (ARSO) policy and set it to Disabled! 4. How Personal Data Encryption Works Let\u2019s break down how PDE handles your files in a few simple steps before diving in and decompiling the code: File Encryption During Creation When you create or save a file in a protected folder,Personal Data Encryption (PDE)immediately encrypts it. This process happens seamlessly in the background, requiring no manual intervention (unless you\u2019re experimenting with it, like I do). Session-Specific Encryption Keys PDE ties encryption keys to your active login session. These keys remain in \u201cmemory\u201d while you\u2019re signed in and decrypt files as needed. When you log out, the keys are securely wiped from \u201cmemory\u201d, leaving encrypted files inaccessible. Windows Hello Integration PDE integrates withWindows Hello for Business, ensuring encryption keys are only accessible through Hello credentials, such as PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition. Logging in via Hello loads the necessary encryption keys. File Access and Locking Once you log out, your files are locked and encrypted. Even if another user, an administrator, or the SYSTEM account tries to access them, they remain securely protected. Easy does it, right? Let\u2019s check out how it looks on the device itself once it is activated 5. Checking Personal Data Encryption on Your Device Here\u2019s how you can confirm PDE is active on your devices: Logging in to the DeviceWhen selecting \u201cother user\u201d and trying to log in to the device, will prompt you that you need to sign in with Windows Hello to access files your organization has encrypted on this device. When selecting \u201cother user\u201d and trying to log in to the device, will prompt you that you need to sign in with Windows Hello to access files your organization has encrypted on this device. Desktop IconsFiles in protected folders like Desktop or Documents will show alock iconaka Padlock, indicating they are PDE-encrypted. Files in protected folders like Desktop or Documents will show alock iconaka Padlock, indicating they are PDE-encrypted. When taking a closer look at the properties of a document and asking for the Attributes (1) Encryption details (2), we can indeed spot that it has been encrypted with Personal Data Encryption and the protection is turned on after sign-on. Registry SettingsGo to HKEY_USERS\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\EFS\\PDE.You\u2019ll see PathsProtected, which lists the folders that PDE is protecting. Go to HKEY_USERS\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\EFS\\PDE. You\u2019ll see PathsProtected, which lists the folders that PDE is protecting. More on these wonderful PDE keys later on, as they are not tamper-protected or read-only. I guess the EdpCredentials key needs more attention, so I will write an additional blog about them. Task SchedulerPDE is maintained by thePDE Conversion Maintenance Task, which does amazing things when you manually kick it off. I am going to zoom in to this later on. PDE is maintained by thePDE Conversion Maintenance Task, which does amazing things when you manually kick it off. I am going to zoom in to this later on. 6. Taking a look at a Protected File To examine the encrypted Personal Data file, we can use theciphertool. A single command will reveal both the compatibility level and the file\u2019s protection status. When the user is still logged in, it\u2019s clear that personal data encryption is disabled. However, reviewing the file\u2019s key details below shows thatAES-256encryption has been applied. 7. Checking the Event Logs When your files are being protected or maybe decrypted you may want to check out the event log if you want to know what\u2019s happening. To do so, you need to check out the EFS event log For example, if you added some folders to PDE to encrypt, you may want to look out for EFS event 4434. As shown below it will show us that personal data encryption conversion is completed. Besides showing some informational stuff, you may want to keep an eye out for event 4432! This one will inform you that a different user attempted to access the user personal encrypted data and was denied access! 8. PDE vs. EFS: Key Differences Before diving into PDE further, first, a small overview of EFS vs PDE to make the difference between them a bit more clear. So EFS is not PDE, but it has some close interactions with it as we also noticed with the EFS event log 9. Real-World Testing We tested PDE in different scenarios to understand its behavior. Why I did so? Well as I was wondering if it was possible for other local administrators to access or decrypt the data when the user was still logged on and/or logged off! Here\u2019s what we found: Scenario 1: SYSTEM Account with Protected User Logged Off Ran cipher /c on a PDE-protected file from the SYSTEM account while the user was logged off Output: \u201cKey information cannot be retrieved.\u201d And the specified file could not be decrypted The SYSTEM account could not access or decrypt the file because the session keys were not available in memory. Without the user session keys, the file could not be decrypted or accessed even not from the system account when the user was not logged in. Scenario 2: SYSTEM Account with Protected User Logged In Ran cipher /c on a PDE-protected file from the SYSTEM account while the user was logged in. The SYSTEM account successfully retrieved the key information. The SYSTEM account couldreadthe file because the session keys were loaded in memory. If the user is logged in, SYSTEM can temporarily access the file by leveraging the session\u2019s loaded encryption keys. Scenario 3: Local Administrator Access with Protected User Logged In Attempted to access and decrypt the PDE-protected file using a local administrator account while the user was logged in. The local administrator could not access the file. Decrypting the file failed, even though the user was logged in PDE enforces strict session-based access, ensuring that only the user who encrypted the file can decrypt it. Other administrators are blocked. Scenario 4: SYSTEM Account After Protected User Logoff Ran cipher /d on a PDE-protected file from the *SYSTEM account after the user logged off. *Psexec required, which requires local Administrator privileges The SYSTEM account was unable to decrypt or access the file, as the PDE keys had been erased from memory. Once the user logs off, all access is blocked \u2013 even for SYSTEM. PDE\u2019s design ensures that encryption keys are session-bound and discarded when the user logs out. Scenario 5: SYSTEM Decryption with Protected User Logged In Attempted to decrypt the PDE-protected file from the SYSTEM account while the user was logged in. Before looking at the results, let\u2019s look at the official MSFT documentation: It mentions that other users on the device who aren\u2019t owners of the content will be denied access to the file: Shall we look at the results then? Surprisingly, the SYSTEM account was able to decrypt the file. However, the cipher /c output indicated that only the original user (MMSMOARudy) should have been able to decrypt it. Once the user logged out, SYSTEM could no longer access or decrypt the file. This unexpected behavior suggests that SYSTEM can sometimes leverage the active session keys to perform decryption while the user is logged in. However, this access is revoked as soon as the user logs off. So ensure you have the ASR rule in place to block PSEXEC. Scenario 6: Sharing the Document Sharing the document encrypted with PDE with someone else out of your organization The encryption of the document \u201clives\u201d on the device itself so people are still able to open it. Let me explain a bit more. When you are sharing the file, you are in fact sharing the file that got uploaded to SharePoint. The personal date encryption happens on the device and not on the file that is uploaded to Sharepoint. Scenario 7: Altering and deleting the file Trying to delete and change the file protected with personal data encryption from the additional logged in local administrator. As shown below I could change the file name of the protected file. Besides changing the file name, we could also delete the file. 10. Adding More Folders to Personal Data Encryption After doing some testing, I was curious if we could add more folders to the Personal Data encryption. As always, I started reading the documentation. When looking at the official MSFT Personal Data Encryption documentation, we notice that it mentions the fact that we could use the personal data encryption APIs to specify which content to protect. (Level 2 PDE) Well\u2026. That makes sense. Looking at the Personal Data encryption code showed me a couple of fun things.PathsinPolicyandPathsProtected. When reading through the test, it seems that these registry keys are being used to enable personal data encryption on those selected folders. Well\u2026 let\u2019s try it ourselves then! Updating thePathsInpolicyregistry keys inside the EFSPDE folder. Updating thePathsInpolicyregistry keys inside the EFSPDE folder. You need to add a PIPE to both of the registry values as shown below. For example I added the C:\\temp folder. Please Note: You only need to change the PathsInpolicy registry value, the PathsProtected will be updated accordingly. 2. But how are we going to encrypt or ensure that PDE is aware of this folder? As shown above, we can\u2019t manually encrypt those files\u2026 Well, let\u2019s first look at what the files in the c: temp folder look like after I performed my magic trick. As shown above, the files in the C:\\temp now also show the padlock and are protected. How did we kick off this encryption? Let\u2019s find out, shall we? 11. Encrypting Files Manually with PDE Before showing you how to do so, let\u2019s take a look at another important note, Microsoft added to the Personal Data Encryption documentation. It mentions that once a user selects to manually decrypt a file, the user won\u2019t be able to manually protect the file again using PDE. Remember, I am the weird one that looks at code\u2026 and while looking at the efsutil.dll I noticed something funny. It mentions the task scheduled folder PDE\u2026 and how it creates that maintenance schedule if necessary. If we look closer to the schedule itself, we will notice that it will trigger the efsui.exe and the /efs /pdeconvert maintenance parameters (which are also mentioned in the code) Let\u2019s take a look at what happens when we have decrypted a file and kick off that schedule by looking at a YouTube video. https://youtu.be/58v0EUqL7l4 Exactly !!! after running the PDE maintenance task manually, those decrypted files are being encrypted on the fly!! isn\u2019t that wonderful? Known Issues with Personal Data Encryption If you\u2019re encountering error0x80070043when trying to launch an executable on a device withPersonal Data Encryption (PDE)enabled, chances are you\u2019ve also implementedLocal Administrator Protectionon that same device. Here\u2019s the issue:Personal Data Encryptionand Local Administrator Protection don\u2019t always play nicely together when it comes to running executables.Why? Because Local Administrator Protection relies on avirtual account for elevation, and guess what that virtual accountdoesn\u2019t have access to?Exactly. Want to know more?Read the full blog below! Please Note: Endpoint Privilege Management will also give you the same error when trying to elevate an executable when it\u2019s protected with Personal Data Encryption https://patchmypc.com/fixing-personal-data-encryption-error-0x80070043 Conclusion Personal Data Encryption is a significant step forward in securing personal user files on Windows devices. By tying encryption to the user session and Windows Hello, PDE ensures that files remain private and secure, even in environments where multiple users or admins have access. I had fun digging into the inner workings of PDE\u2026. one thing is for sure! once you log off, those files are locked tighter than ever.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-diagnostics-wns-issue/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Collect Diagnostics: How It Works & The Missing WNS Push Notification Issue Have you ever wondered howIntune\u2019s Collect Diagnosticsfeature gathers logs from managed devices? In this deep dive, we break down the entire process, from Graph API requests to CSP execution, and uncover why the expected WNS push notification wasn\u2019t being sent, forcing us to trigger a sync manually. Introduction: Intune Collect Diagnostics One of the most useful troubleshooting features when managing devices through Microsoft Intune is the ability to collectdiagnostics logsfrom a device remotely (of course, theAutopilotDiagnostics Toolis also pretty great). This allows IT administrators to gather detailed diagnostic data, including event logs, policy status, registry values, and connectivity information, to investigate issues without bothering the end user or requiring physical access to the device.Intune\u2019s \u201cCollect Diagnostics\u201d feature initiates this process, triggering a device check-in and collecting the diagnostics. In an ideal scenario, this should happen almost immediately (well after 5 minutes) after pressing the \u201cCollect Diagnostics\u201d button, thanks toWindows Notification Services (WNS)sending a push notification to the device. However, we recently observed that the WNS push notification wasn\u2019t being sent at all, forcing us to manually initiate a sync in Intune. But before diving into this issue, let\u2019s first break down how the remote diagnostics process should work from start to finish. So prepare yourself for another Deep Dive! How Intune Collect Diagnostics Work (Step-by-Step Flow) 1. Admin Initiates Remote Log Collection in Intune The admin selects a managed device in Intune and clicks \u201cCollect Diagnostics.\u201d This action triggers a Graph API request to start the log collection process. 2. Graph API Sends a Device Log Collection Request When the Collect diagnostics button is pressed A POST request is sent to:https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/{deviceId}/createDeviceLogCollectionRequest In big lines, This GraphCreateDeviceLogCollectionRequestCommand will instruct the device to gather diagnostics and upload them to a specfied Azure Blob Storage URL. Let\u2019s find out how that works 3. WNS Push Notification Should Be Sent to the Device Intune attempts to trigger an immediate device sync viaWindows Notification Services (WNS).The expected push notification looks like this: PUSHROUTERSUBMITORIGIN_EE_MDMDIAGNOSTICS If successful, the device should create a new scheduled task to check in with Intune to retrieve the command. If the device is offline, it should sync as soon as it reconnects. 4. Device Creates a 5-Minute Queued Task for Sync If the push notification is received, Windows will create a scheduled task with a 5-minute delay before executing the deviceenroller.exe that will require the device to check in to the service. This 5 minutes queued task, is visible in Event Viewer under:PushLaunch: Queued schedule created for queued alerts This mechanism is likely in place to prevent duplicate check-ins (with MMP-C also asking the device to check in). If you want to know more about this queued schedule, please readthis blog: 5. Device Syncs & Retrieves CSP Command (If Push Works) If the WNS push notification is successfully received, the device processes the sync request with a 5-minute delay. After 5 minutes, the OMA-DM Client kicks off and retrieves theArchiveDefinitionDiagnosticLog CSPcommand:./Vendor/MSFT/DiagnosticLog/DiagnosticArchive/ArchiveDefinition This DiagnosticLog CSP commandtells the device to start collecting diagnostic logs. 6. DiagnosticLog CSP Executes the Request From there on, the OMA-DM Client starts asking thediagnosticlogscsp.dllto process the request. The diagnosticlogscsp.dll processes the request by calling the DLL function:CArchiveDefinitionNode::Execute This Execute function will start doing some funny things. Create a working directory for temporary storage. C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp Create a working directory for temporary storage. C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp As shown above, it will generate an `input.xml` file in that same directory that defines what logs to collect. As shown above, it will generate an `input.xml` file in that same directory that defines what logs to collect. Thisinput.xmlis, in fact, the content that we also received with the CSP From then on, it will execute `MdmDiagnosticsTool.exe`to collect the actual log. 7. MdmDiagnosticsTool.exe` Runs and Collects Logs The tool is executed with parameters like:C:\\Windows\\System32\\MdmDiagnosticsTool.exe -xml C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\input.xml -zip C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\mdmdiagnostics -server As we have seen earlier, the `input.xml` file dictates exactly what diagnostics data is collected, including: \u2013 Registry keys (e.g., Intune Policies, device management settings).\u2013 Event logs (e.g., device check-in history, Autopilot events, security logs).\u2013 Intune and Windows update logs.\u2013 Network connectivity logs. We can spot this behavior when looking closer at theArchiveDefinitionNode::Execute(diagnosticlogcsp.dll). With the mdmdiagnosticstool knowing what to do, it will start the collection of the diagnostic data. This diagnostic log collection itself has been taken care of by thecreatemdmenterprisediagnosticsreportfunction in the MDMdiagnostics.dll Besides collecting the regular logs, the Diagnostic Report function will also kick off the CreateLogCabOnArea function. This function will contact the windows.management.service.dll (Autopilot) by performing an API call and asking for the Autopilot logs. When performing the API call, it will retrieve the datasourceinfo.json file. This JSON file holds the Autopilot Event logs/files and registry keys it needs to gather. 8. Logs Are Compressed & Uploaded to Intune Once all the diagnostic data is collected, the logs are zipped into a single `.zip` file:C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\mdmdiagnostics.zipThe device uploads the ZIP file to the Azure Blob Storage URL provided in the CSP request. 9. Admin Downloads the Logs from Intune Once uploaded, the log file becomes available for download in the Intune Admin Center. The admin can analyze the logs to troubleshoot enrollment, policy, and connectivity issues. Admin downloads the logs from the Intune portal for analysis Process Flow Summary Process Flow Mermaid Flow The Issue: WNS Push Notification Was Not Sent at All While investigating this process and writing this blog, we noticed that when we initiated \u201cCollect Diagnostics,\u201d the expected WNS push notification wasn\u2019t being sent at all. As a result:The device never received the command to check in automatically. (or we needed to wait until the 8 hour sync schedule task kicked in)Logs weren\u2019t being collected until we manually triggered a sync. Workaround: Manually Syncing the Device Since the WNS push notification wasn\u2019t triggering a check-in, we had to manually force the device to sync by:1. Going to Intune Admin Center.2. Selecting the affected device.3. Clicking \u201cSync\u201d to manually trigger a check-in. After doing this, the device successfully pulled the CSP command and collected and uploaded the logs as expected. Within 10 minutes, the diagnostic logs were available for us to download. Final Thoughts & Key Takeaways \u2705 Intune Remote Diagnostics is designed to work via Graph API, CSP, and WNS.\u2705 Windows always schedules a 5-minute delay before executing sync requests.\u2705 If WNS works, the device syncs after the delay, and logs are collected.\u2705 If WNS fails, the device never syncs, requiring a manual check-in.\u2705 Manually clicking \u201cSync\u201d in Intune forces the device to process the log collection command.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-company-portal-app-refreshed/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Company Portal App Refreshed! This blog will focus on the new look of the improved Intune Company Portal UI and examine how this refreshed look will also improve the user experience! Introduction The Intune Company Portal app is designed to make life easier for both end users and IT administrators. It allows users to install third-party applications, corporate apps, and other apps. Luckily, Patch My PC has almost every app you need in its catalog. This ensures that the end user can manually install every app they need on their own. After opening the new, improved Intune Company Portal app, the end user can install the app themselves by selecting it and clicking on install. Easy, right? Giving end users the possibility to install (or uninstall) applications on their own turf also means the IT administrator doesn\u2019t have to deploy every app during the Autopilot process. This can save time and reduce errors during device enrollment. The app\u2019s simple design and real-time updates make it user-friendly, while also helping IT teams manage apps and monitor compliance more effectively. Overall, the new Company Portal makes application deployment and device management more straightforward and efficient. Key Features and Improvements Let\u2019s look at some graphical improvements Microsoft implemented to give the Company Portal app a nice makeover. Company Portal App Home Page The Home page now displays apps, including featured ones, and shows a device status overview in the top right corner. The side menu icons have also been updated for a fresher look. Downloads & Updates The Downloads & Updates page lists installed apps and apps currently in the download queue. For instance, you can see FileZilla Client is installing, and its progress has just reached 100%. After it finishes installing successfully, the famous toast message will appear, mentioning that the FileZilla Client application was just installed. Notifications A new Notifications button on the Company Portal app\u2019s home page provides quick access to the latest notifications. With these notifications, you can quickly determine if an application failed to install. For example, if an application fails to install, you will receive a notification that mentions which apps failed to install. Company Portal Device Page The Device page highlights compliance status in a color-coded block, making it easier for users to spot issues. Users can view suggested remediation steps, review device information, and take necessary actions for their device. In the example below, the Company Portal app shows that I am good to go and that I can securely access the company resources. If my device status changes, I could easily try to fix it myself by clicking on Check Access. This will make sure that the device attempts to retrieve the latest compliance status. Now that we have examined the major changes let\u2019s find out how we could deploy the new Company Portal version and improve user onboarding. How to Deploy the Preview Version Manually Before the Company Portal reached General Availability (GA), you were required to download the preview version from the Microsoft Download Center manually. Download Microsoft Intune Company Portal Redesign for Windows from Official Microsoft Download Center Once you download the new Intune Company Portal, Upload the Company Portal app installation file and all necessary dependencies for your device architecture. After selecting the proper appx bundle file, you must also upload the required files based on the Windows Operating system architecture. In the example below, I selected the x64 versions. Once you have uploaded all the required files, you must assign the app to a small group of test devices or users. Also, make sure that you configure the install context toDevice Context. If you\u2019re using Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DPP), you\u2019ll need to assign the Company Portal to the same just-in-time device group you configured in the Autopilot profile. Alternatively, you could assign it to all devices, but that\u2019s probably not the most efficient approach. Fortunately, in October, Microsoft rolled out a new version of the Company Portal, bringing with it the ability to leverage the built-in Microsoft Store option. How to Deploy the new UI Company Portal Automatically During the week of October 7th, Microsoft announced the updated UI for the Intune Company Portal app on Windows. With this update, any existing Company Portal installations on devices will automatically get the new version. Plus, admins can now deploy the Company Portal straight from the Microsoft Store, making the deployment process even easier! Please Note:When assigning it to System, you could run into issues when using AP-DPP, so please make sure it is configured to User. Conclusion The updated Company Portal App UI has a fresh design and improved user experience. With this refreshed new Company Portal, installing the applications published with Patch, My PC is going to be a lot more fun!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/demystifying-timestamping-securing-scripts-cab/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Demystifying Timestamping: Securing Scripts and CAB Files for WSUS, ConfigMgr, and Intune In this blog we\u2019ll demystify timestamping, cover why it\u2019s an important process in the management of third-party apps and updates in WSUS, ConfigMgr and WSUS, and how you can test it effectively. When managing third-party applications and updates with tools like WSUS, ConfigMgr, and Intune is important to ensure the security and integrity of the files and scripts that you utilise. Digitally signing scripts and files with a code-signing certificate serves as their official badge of authenticity, verifying they come from a trusted source and haven\u2019t been tampered with. One, often overlooked, aspect of the signing process is timestamping. Timestamping is considered the \u201cproof of age\u201d for your signed scripts and files and ensures their authenticity remains valid even after the signing certificate itself expires. What is Timestamping Timestamping is a process that securely records the exact date and time when a file or script is signed. It works by embedding a timestamp, provided by a trusted Timestamp Authority (TSA), into the file or script\u2019s digital signature. This ensures that the signature remains valid even if the signing certificate expires or is revoked. The process relies on cryptographic methods to link the timestamp with the file or script\u2019s signature, creating a tamper-proof record. When a file with a timestamped signature is verified, the timestamp confirms the integrity and authenticity of the file or script, regardless of the certificate\u2019s current status. This makes timestamping essential for long-term trust and compliance, especially in environments where files may need to be validated years after they were signed. In the image below you can see a CAB file signed and then counter-signed by a TSA. Do we really need to Timestamp our stuff? Granted, code-signing alone proves authenticity, but without timestamping, a file\u2019s trustworthiness ends with the certificate\u2019s validity period. Timestamping addresses this gap by preserving a snapshot of the file\u2019s authenticity at the moment it was signed, often referred to as Long Term Validation (LTV). This means: Files remain verifiable, reducing disruptions caused by expired certificates. It is easy to distinguish between files or scripts signed before a certificate was revoked and those signed after, preventing misuse of compromised certificates. Organizations can confidently rely on legacy updates and scripts without worrying about certificate expiration. How does Timestamping work? Here\u2019s how the timestamping process typically works: File Signing\u2013 A cryptographic hash of the file (e.g. cab or ps1) is created. Timestamp Request\u2013 The hash is sent to a trusted Timestamp Authority (TSA) (e.g. http://timestamp.digicert.com). Timestamp Token\u2013 The TSA generates a timestamp token, signing it with its private key and appending the current date and time. Validation\u2013 The signed file now includes the timestamp, which can be validated using the TSA\u2019s public key. Timestamping with PowerShell Those accustomed to PowerShell may already be familiar with theSet-AuthenticodeSignaturecmdlet which can be used to code-sign scripts and files. We can also use theGet-AuthenticodeSignaturecmdlet to view information about a signed script of file. Alternatively,SignToolwhich comes with the Windows SDK can be quite useful to view and create digital signatures. Note:If you want to experiment with Signtool, the Windows SDK can be downloaded fromhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk After installing the SDK, you can locate SignTool in the following directory: In the following example, we will use a code-signing certificate to sign a CAB file using theSet-AuthenticodeSignaturecmdlet. The cmdlet does not directly support handling the .pfx from a path so we must import it as an X509Certificate2 object first. We will also use a well know TSA for the timestamping \u2013http://timestamp.digicert.com. Signtool is really quite nice because it can handle the .pfx file directly, and accepts a plain password string, simplifying the command somewhat for testing. Using either method, the result is a signed CAB file that has been timestamped (co-signed with the TSA private key). We can also use the same approach for signing scripts. Just update the fileToSign variable in the previous code snippet to:- When signing scripts, the Signature Block is evidence the script has been signed. Note:If you edit the script AFTER the script has been signed, this signature is invalidated. Patch My PC Publisher Timestamping When it comes to digitally signing files and adding a timestamp to third-party updates using the Patch My PC Publisher, both the Publisher and Microsoft\u2019s SignTool utility achieve the same core objective \u2013 ensuring file integrity and establishing the authenticity of the source. However, the methods differ slightly. The Publisher explicitly interacts with the Windows cryptographic API, specifically theCryptUIWizDigitalSignfunction, by passing in a structure that contains file information, certificate details, and an optional timestamp server URL. This low-level approach allows the Publisher precise control over the signing process, including handling custom signing options and error scenarios. The option to enable timestamping in the Publisher can be found on theAdvancedtab. An example of a signed WSUS update CAB file using the Patch My PC service with Timestamping enabled can be found below. What can go wrong with Timestamping? Several challenges can arise during the timestamping process, not limited to:- CRL/OCSP Validation Failures\u2013 Blocked URLs for Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) failures can prevent validation of the timestamping server\u2019s certificate. Timestamp Server URL Blocked\u2013 Firewalls or proxies may block access to the timestamp server, resulting in failed timestamping. Invalid or Expired Server Certificate\u2013 An outdated or untrusted timestamp server certificate can cause the signature to be invalid. Enforced Timestamping Policy\u2013 If timestamping is mandatory, any failure in the process will block the signature entirely. System Clock Issues\u2013 An incorrect system clock can lead to validation errors or rejected timestamps. Firewalls are the main cause of frustration when it comes to the timestamping process and it is sometime difficult to know which URLs a TSA leverages without fully understanding the response from the TSA server. Bouncy Castle Cryptography Library TheBouncy Castle cryptography libraryis a powerful tool for working with cryptographic data and standards and is especially useful when dealing with timestamping. It simplifies the process of handling cryptographic formats like ASN.1 which is essential for timestamping operations. Using the Bouncy Castle crypto library, we can create and send requests to a timestamp server and parse and analyse the response to understand if a timestamping operation is successful. The library is critical to assist with decoding the response, which is in a complex ASN.1 format. We can load the BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll in our PowerShell code and make some requests to a TSA and review the response. PowerShell Example In the example below, we take a CAB file, grab the hash and send it to the DigiCert TSA and review the response using the Bouncy Castle library. The response indicates that a timestamp was retrieved successfully from the TSA. PowerShell Solution Combining both the SignTool from Microsoft and the Bouncy Castle library, we can create a small test environment to understand if timestamping is going to work effectively in our own environment. The solution below will:- Digitally sign a specified file by generating a self-signed code-signing certificate (certificate is saved as a pfx). Applies a trusted timestamp to the signed file using a timestamp server (e.g. DigiCert TSA). Extracts and saves the certificates used by the timestamp server for validation. Extracts and displays the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) distribution points from the timestamp server\u2019s certificates. Ensures the integrity and authenticity of signed files for future verification. Extracts additional metadata from the timestamp response, including certificate details, hash algorithm, policy OID, and serial number. The solution can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/PatchMyPCTeam/Community-Scripts/blob/main/Other/Timestamping/Test-TimeStamping.ps1 Solution Requirements The Bouncy Castle library is required for ASN.1 parsing and timestamp-related cryptographic operations. Download the BouncyCastle.Cryptography NuGet package fromhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle.Cryptography. Extract and place theBouncyCastle.Crypto.dllin the same directory as the script. Signtool.exe is a part of the Windows SDK and is required for signing and timestamping files. Download the Windows SDK fromhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk After installing the SDK, locatesigntool.exeinC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<version>\\<architecture>\\signtool.exe Placesigntool.exein the same directory as the script. Script Parameters The script will attempt to create a directory which will be used to generate the test files, certificates and store the timestamp server response. Explorer.exe is copied into this directory and this binary is used to make the CAB file. Note:Running the script with the default parameters is sufficient to perform a basic test to the TSA. The output will look something like below. As the most common cause for timestamping failure is Firewalls, we write the CRLs involved in the timestamping operation that came back in the timestamping response. The script also shows each operation which is useful to understand the flow. Summary Timestamping is a crucial addition to code-signing that ensures the long-term trust and validity of digitally signed files. By embedding a timestamp from a TSA, you can protect your scripts and files against certificate expirations or revocations \u2013 Ensuring their long term validity. If you are responsible for managing third-party applications and updates with tools like WSUS, ConfigMgr, or Intune, understanding and implementing timestamping is vital for compliance and operational reliability. Key Takeaways Timestamping matters because it extends the trustworthiness of your signed files beyond the validity of the certificate itself. Tools like SignTool, PowerShell, and the Bouncy Castle library make testing and troubleshooting timestamping very easy. Patch My PC takes security seriously.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/troubleshooting-windows-feature-updates-enrollment/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Troubleshooting Windows Feature Updates Enrollment with Graph Introduction ManagingWindows Feature Updatesvia Intune and Windows Update for Business (WUfB) should be straightforward\u2026.at least, in theory. We configured aFeature Updates Policyto ensure all existing (not newly enrolled) Windows 11 23H2 devices were going to be upgraded to 24H2, but something unexpected happened. At first, everything looked fine. The policy was applied, most devices were successfully upgraded to Windows 24h2, and the Windows Feature update reporting in Intune reflected the expected rollout. But then, after a couple of days, We noticed that one particular stubborn device still had not upgraded, while every other targeted device had. Weird! It\u2019s time for some deep troubleshooting. 1. Setting Up the Windows Feature Update Policy in Intune We deployed a Feature Update Policy in Intune to ensure that all 23H2 devices would be upgraded to Windows 11 24H2. Feature Update Policy Settings: Windows 11, version 24H2 (targeted deployment). Applicable devices: All devices running Windows 11 23H2. Deadline settings: These are applied for automatic update and restart scheduling. Update deferral: None (immediate rollout). 2. The Device Missing from Windows Feature Updates Reporting Somehow, the device refused to play ball and did not accept the Windows feature Update policy at all. Since the problem device was online, I installed Fiddler, started Procmon, and pressed the \u201csearch for updates\u201d button. After a few seconds, the device returned empty-handed and showed me it had received no updates. Let\u2019s dive in and examine what Fiddler and Procmon showed me! The moment the device starts searching for updates, it reaches out to the service (delivery.mp.microsoft.com) While communicating with the service, the device will hand over some important device attributes. We can spot this flow in the DLLs. As shown below, the getDeviceAttributes will fetch all the required attributes from the device. The same thing can be seen in the Windows update log, which can be generated with theget-windowsupdatelogPowerShell command. If we format this list of attributes we noticed in the Windows Update log, it showed me some useful information: As shown above, DSS_ENROLLED=QualityUpdate. That\u2019s weird. Where does theMousocoreworkerget this information from? Luckily, I had procmon open and running, and within the same seconds the device reached out to the service, I noticed it checked the ctac.json in the system32 folder. This JSON above showed me, which key I must inspect to find the WUfB-DS Enrollment Status. Checked: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WufbDS enrollmenttype, it should mention: QualityUpdate, FeatureUpdate\u2026 But it only showed me the QualityUpdate. The whole FeatureUpdate category was missing! Was the device not enrolled with WUfB DSS? By the looks of it, it wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. 3. Digging Deeper: The Device Was Stuck \u201cEnrolling\u201d in Graph Luckily, my Patch My PC colleague Bryan Dam delivered a wonderful presentation about Graph and Windows Feature Update and WUfB-DS in the past. So with that information, I knew where to start poking. I opened the Graph Explorer and started querying the Graph API to determine the enrollment state. First, I needed to fetch the device ID. After I got the device ID, I fired off a GET request. Graph API Query:https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/updatableAssets/{device_id} As shown above, the response showed me: \u201cfeature\u201d: {\u201cenrollmentState\u201d: \u201cenrolling\u201d}. Does this mean the device was still getting enrolled for the feature updates? When doing the same on devices that were successfully upgraded to Windows 24h2 using the Feature Update policy, it showed me that they were \u201cEnrolled\u201d instead of \u201cenrolling\u201d 4. Fixing the Issue: Unenrolling and Re-Enrolling the Device With the device being stuck enrolling, I decided to try to unenroll the device first from WUfB-DS\u2026 maybe it works\u2026, or maybe it won\u2019t. Step 1: Unenroll from Windows Feature Update with the Graph API To unenroll the device for the Windows Feature Updates update category, I performed a POST to this Graph URI https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/updatableAssets/unenrollAssets To be sure it was unenrolled, I performed the same step as I did first to determine the enrollment state again. As shown above, it still showed me the Enrolling state. Was it still being unenrolled? (or I just didn\u2019t have any patience!) Step 2: Delete the device from WUfB \u2013 DS With me, not having the patience those things require, I decided just to delete the device and enroll it again from WUfB-DS management. I did so by sending a delete command toDELETEthe whole device from the WUfB-DS service.https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/updatableAssets/76ba670e-ee34-4d32-b8ab-f24283802953 After the device was successfully deleted, I again performed a GET request to make sure it was gone. Well, one thing was for sure\u2026 the device was no longer enrolled. With the device not being enrolled anymore, I decided to get myself a cup of coffee before re-enrollment (patience is key) Step 3: Re-Enroll the Device With the device no longer enrolled, I did a similar graph call, but now I have made sure I am going to add the device again. https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/updatableAssets/enrollassets After I enrolled the device again to the WUfB DS service, I decided to be patient and start doing something else. The next morning, I wondered if the status had changed. Whoop!! The enrollment state has now changed from enrolling to enrolled! With the device now being enrolled, I switched back to the device 5. Success! Windows 11 24H2 Installed I logged into the problem device and opened Windows Update. When opening Windows Update, I immediately spotted the 24h2 being installed and waiting for a pending restart (luckily, withHotpatch, reboots would be a bit less) 6. Key Takeaways If a device doesn\u2019t appear in Feature Update reporting, check Graph API. Verify the WUfB-DS Registry Keys. Check if your device has a valid device token If a device is stuck, unenroll and re-enroll it via Graph API. Be patient! WUfB DS sometimes needs more time to think about it. Sometimes, recreating the Windows Feature update policy and assigning it to the device group again helps. 7. Conclusion This troubleshooting experience highlights an important lesson: just because a device is online and checking for updates doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s properly enrolled in Windows Update for Business DS Service. If you ever find yourself with a device missing from feature update reporting, follow these steps to resolve the issue.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/cyber-attacks/", "title": "", "raw_text": "10 Types of Cyber Attacks $500 GIFT INSIDE!We\u2019ve all learned to recognize and avoid suspicious emails with subjects like this. Yet, while our vigilance has grown, so has the sophistication of cybercriminals. Their methods have evolved and become increasingly deceptive and difficult to detect. In light of this, staying informed and proactive in protecting ourselves against cyber attacks is crucial. Join me as we dive into the top 10 types of cyber attacks, empowering you to protect both your personal and professional endeavors from harm. I\u2019ve never been hacked before, so why should I care? You\u2019ll want to take this seriously if you care about your financial and mental well-being. The consequences of a successful cyber attack can be devastating, both personally and professionally. Cyber attackers can steal sensitive information, disrupt business operations, and cause significant financial losses. An example of this is the \u201cWannaCry\u201d ransomware attack that occurred in May 2017. WannaCry exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems, allowing attackers to encrypt files on infected computers and demand a payment in Bitcoin to unlock the data. If this ransom was not paid, the group threatened to release the victims\u2019 personal information. The virus spread rapidly across the globe, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, including personal computers, businesses, and even critical infrastructure like hospitals. Individuals targeted by WannaCry found their personal files encrypted and inaccessible unless they paid a fee of several hundred dollars. With just this one example, you should be able to see that cyber attacks are a pretty big deal. Now, let\u2019sreallyget into it! Top 10 Types of Cyber Attacks 1. Phishing Attacks A phishing attack is a type of cyber attack in which attackers try to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. These attacks typically involve fraudulent emails, text messages, or websites that appear to be from legitimate sources, but in reality, a cyber attacker is on the other end attempting to steal confidential information. Look out for: Suspicious Sender Addresses: Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to, but are not exactly the same as, those of legitimate companies. For instance, an email from \u201c[email protected]\u201d instead of \u201c[email protected]\u201c. Generic Greetings: Be cautious of emails that start with generic salutations like \u201cDear Customer\u201d instead of your actual name. Urgent or Threatening Language: Phishing attempts frequently create a sense of urgency or fear, warning that your account will be suspended or that you need to act immediately. Unexpected Attachments or Links: Don\u2019t click on any attachments or links. Phishing links may direct you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Spelling and Grammar Errors: Many phishing messages contain noticeable spelling and grammatical mistakes. Phishing is a prevalent threat, but by staying vigilant and following these guidelines, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these scams. If you\u2019re ever unsure, contact the company to double-check the email or message is truly from them. And always remember: when in doubt, it\u2019s better to be on the side of caution. 2. SQL Injection Attack SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in a website or application\u2019s database by manipulating the queries an application makes to its database. By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, such as search boxes or login forms, attackers can reveal or alter sensitive information, execute administrative operations, or even delete data. Here is an example of how this could look: This query will check the database for the credentials inputted by a user: An attacker can modify the query to something like this: The Result of This SQL Injection The conditionOR \u20181\u2019=\u20191\u2032is always true, causing the query to return all rows in theuserstable. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication without knowing any valid usernames or passwords. Developers can better protect their applications against SQL injection attacks typically by using parameterized queries or prepared statements that safely handle user input. If you\u2019re looking for more information on this topic, this OSAWP guide dives deeper into how developers can prevent SQL injection attacks:SQL Injection Prevention \u2013 OWASP Cheat Sheet Series. 3. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The goal is to force a website, computer, or online service offline and render it unavailable to its intended users. Different methods of executing aDenial-of-ServiceAttack There are many different types of DoS attacks. Some of these include: Volume-Based Attacks: Floods the target with a huge amount of data to overwhelm it.Example: Sending too many simultaneous requests to a website. Example: Sending too many simultaneous requests to a website. Protocol-Based Attacks: Exploits weaknesses in network protocols to disrupt communication.Example: Sending lots of connection requests to a server to make it unavailable for others. Example: Sending lots of connection requests to a server to make it unavailable for others. Application Layer Attacks: Targets specific software vulnerabilities to crash or slow down systems.Example: Making repeated, slow requests to a website to exhaust its resources. Example: Making repeated, slow requests to a website to exhaust its resources. Resource Depletion Attacks: Exhaust system resources like memory or CPU power.Example: Sending a large, malformed packet to crash a network device. Example: Sending a large, malformed packet to crash a network device. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Amplifies attacks by using many computers to flood the target.Example: Using a botnet (i.e., a network of compromised computers) to flood a website with traffic. Example: Using a botnet (i.e., a network of compromised computers) to flood a website with traffic. The Impact of a Denial-of-Service Attack These attacks can have serious negative implications on a business and its users. Some of these include: Service Disruption: DoS attacks can render targeted services, websites, or networks inaccessible to legitimate users, leading to downtime and disruption of business operations. Loss of Revenue: Downtime from DoS attacks can directly impact revenue generation for businesses, especially those reliant on online services or e-commerce platforms. Damage to Reputation: Prolonged or repeated DoS attacks can erode customer trust and confidence in an organization\u2019s ability to maintain reliable and secure services, leading to reputational damage.Understanding and implementing robust DDoS mitigation strategies is crucial for maintaining the availability and integrity of websites, servers, and networks.Here is a helpful guide by the government of Canada to help protect against a DDoS attack:Protecting your organization against denial of service attacks \u2013 ITSAP.80.100 \u2013 Canadian Centre for Cyber Security 4. Malware Attacks A malware attack involves malicious software (AKA malware) infiltrating a computer, network, or device to cause harm, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions. Malware encompasses a wide range of malicious programs, many of which are listed in greater detail below, that each have their own unique characteristics and functionalities. These malicious programs can be spread in various ways, such as email attachments, infected websites, or software vulnerabilities. Types of Malware Malware is a broad term that can include various types of malicious programs, each designed for different purposes. Some known types of malware are: Viruses: Malware that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads to other files and systems when executed. Worms: Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers over a network. Trojans: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. Once activated, they can create backdoors for other malware. Ransomware: Malware that encrypts the victim\u2019s data and demands a ransom for the decryption key. Spyware: Software that secretly monitors user activity and collects personal information without consent. Adware: Unwanted software designed to display advertisements, often leading to unwanted behavior and privacy concerns. Rootkits: Tools that allow attackers to gain undetected administrative control over a system. Botnets: Networks of infected devices controlled by attackers, often used to conduct large-scale attacks like DDoS. Once installed on a system, malware can perform a multitude of malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, compromising system integrity, disrupting normal operations, encrypting files for ransom, and turning the infected device into a part of a botnet for further attacks. Here are some tips by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to protect against malware:Protect your organization from malware (ITSAP.00.057) \u2013 Canadian Centre for Cyber Security 5. Social Engineering Hacks Social engineering attacks are deceptive tactics used by cybercriminals to manipulate individuals into providing confidential information, gain unauthorized access to systems, or perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking methods that rely on technical vulnerabilities, social engineers use human psychology and behavior to attack their victims. These attacks can come in many different forms, but let\u2019s zero in on one popular tactic. Let\u2019s say a cybercriminal poses as a bank representative and calls a victim, pretending to offer assistance with a supposed security issue. This is how this sort of attack would play out: Caller Impersonation: The cybercriminal spoofs the caller ID to make it appear as if the call is coming from the victim\u2019s bank. Deceptive Introduction: The cybercriminal introduces themselves as a security specialist from the victim\u2019s bank and claims there has been suspicious activity detected on the victim\u2019s account. Creating Urgency: The cybercriminal emphasizes the urgency of the situation, stating that immediate action is required to prevent unauthorized transactions or account compromise. Request for Information: The cybercriminal requests the victim\u2019s personal information, such as account number, Social Security number, or login credentials. Threat of Consequences: The cybercriminal threatens to freeze the victim\u2019s account if they fail to provide their information. Successful Data Theft: If the victim falls for the scam and provides their personal information, the cybercriminal gains access to the victim\u2019s bank account and can now carry out fraudulent transactions or steal sensitive data. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States, they receive millions of reports related to phone call scams like this each year. And this is just one of many popular examples! 6. Cryptojacking Cryptojacking is a type of cyber attack where an attacker uses a victim\u2019s computer, smartphone, or server to mine cryptocurrency without the victim\u2019s knowledge or consent. This can significantly slow down the affected machines, increase electricity consumption, and potentially cause hardware damage due to overheating. One example of this happening is a true story that happened to a friend of mine! Josh discovered that his GPU was being used to mine Bitcoin. This happened through malware that had infiltrated his computer. The malware harnessed the power of Josh\u2019s GPU to solve complex cryptographic problems, generating Bitcoin for the attacker without Josh\u2019s consent or knowledge. Josh realized this when his GPU stats were skyrocketing, his fans were spinning like crazy, and an unknown process was consuming excessive processing power. Josh recognized this and took the necessary steps to remediate it. This guide from the New Jersey Institute of Technology provides information on how to prevent and recover from Cryptojacking attacks:What is Cryptojacking? How to prevent, detect, and recover from it | Information Services and Technology (njit.edu). 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then be executed in the context of the user\u2019s browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities. How XSS Attacks Work Injection: The attacker identifies a vulnerable web application that does not properly sanitize user input, then they inject malicious code into the web application. Execution: When another user visits the compromised web page, the malicious script is executed in their browser as part of the page\u2019s content. Impact: The script can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing cookies or session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, and defacing the website. 8. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop, steal sensitive information, and inject malicious content into the communication stream. Some helpful tips to prevent against a MitM attack: Verify SSL Certificates: Always check for valid SSL certificates when accessing websites. Be cautious of security warnings related to invalid certificates. The lock icon on a web browser indicates the site is secured with a digital certificate, meaning the data being sent between the web server and the computer is encrypted and cannot be read by others. Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions: Do not conduct sensitive activities, such as online banking or shopping, over public Wi-Fi networks. Instead, use a trusted network or a VPN. Regular Software Updates: Keep all software, including operating systems and applications, up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities. In mycompletely non-biased opinion, here is the greatest third-party patching tool to keep all your third-partyapps up to date:Patch My PC: Home Page. 9. Drive-by Download A drive-by download is a type of cyber attack where malicious software is automatically downloaded and installed on a user\u2019s device without their knowledge or consent when they visit a compromised or malicious website. This kind of attack takes advantage of vulnerabilities in web browsers, plugins, or other software to deliver the malware without requiring any explicit action from the user, such as clicking a link or downloading a file. A couple of examples of Drive-by-Downloads1. Angler Exploit KitThe Angler Exploit Kit was a widely used toolkit that facilitated drive-by downloads. It targeted vulnerabilities in popular software like Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Java. When a user visited a website compromised by Angler, the exploit kit scanned the user\u2019s system for vulnerabilities and, if found, installed malware such as ransomware or banking trojans.2. Malvertising CampaignsAttackers often use malicious advertisements, or malvertising, to deliver drive-by downloads. For example, ads on legitimate websites like The New York Times and the BBC were found to contain malicious code. When users visited these sites, the malicious ads exploited browser vulnerabilities to install malware like CryptoLocker ransomware. 10. Password Attack A password attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system, account, or network by obtaining their passwords. These attacks exploit weak or compromised passwords to breach security defenses and can lead to data theft, financial loss, and other malicious activities. Password attacks come in various forms, each using different techniques to crack or steal passwords. Here are some common methods hackers use to compromise passwords: 1. Brute Force Attack Description: Involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Technique: Uses automated software to generate and test a large number of possible passwords. 2. Dictionary Attack Description: Utilizes a precompiled list of common passwords and dictionary words to guess the password. Technique: Automated tools run through a list of likely passwords to find matches. 3. Credential Stuffing Description: Involves using a list of previously breached usernames and passwords to gain access to multiple accounts. Technique: Hackers test stolen credentials across various websites and services using automated scripts. To protect against password attacks, you can implement robust security practices. Use strong, unique passwords for each account to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to gain access even if they obtain your password. Fun fact:My first ever password at the age of 7 was cookeys1. Defend and Deter Understanding the top 10 types of cyber attacks is crucial for ensuring robust cybersecurity defenses. From phishing to ransomware to DDoS, each attack poses unique challenges to individuals and organizations alike. You can implement some preventative measures, such as strong password policies, using firewalls and security software, and keeping software up to date.By staying informed, being proactive, and using the right tools and strategies, you and your business can better safeguard yourself against cyber threats in this increasingly interconnected world. For further information on cybersecurity measures to mitigate any of these attacks, you can explore resources provided by organizations such as theCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).CISA offers comprehensive guidance on best practices to enhance cybersecurity posture and protect against various cyber threats, enabling you to keep your most sensitive data safe and secure.

Not doing so can leave your environment exposed to vulnerabilities, security breaches, malware, and cyber threats. This is where automated patch management software comes into play. Not only does it significantly reduce the likelihood of the negative scenarios above, but it also improves and streamlines the way your IT team handles software updates. What Is Automated Patch Management? Automated patch management can be best described as using automation software to deploy patches, updates, and bug fixes for existing software in an organization\u2019s environment. It\u2019s a multistage approach that covers the entire patch management process, which includes patching, testing, deployment, and monitoring of patch releases to ensure that all systems remain secure and functional. Automating this process requires the use of specific software designed to streamline the patch management processes. These tools are crucial for managing patches across a large number of devices efficiently and reduces the time, cost, and effort required from organizations to keep their third-party applications up to date. What Are the Benefits? Automating patch management brings a lot of value, making it an essential practice for any organization and its respective IT and security teams. Enhanced Security Posture With automated patch management software, you can swiftly fix vulnerabilities and security risks as soon as updates become available. This proactive approach significantly reduces the window of opportunity for cyber threats and ensures your organization\u2019s data remains safe and intact. One of the most common ways computers are exploited is through vulnerabilities in outdated third-party applications or libraries.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/enterprise-app-management/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Enterprise Application Management On February 1st, 2024, Microsoft released the long-promisedEnterprise App Management (EAM)feature as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite or as a standalone add-on. As a bunch of patching nerds with an admitted dose of self-interest, we\u2019ve kept a close eye on what the product team was building. We were excited to dive into the first release and want to share what we found. What is Enterprise Application Management? This new add-on for Microsoft Intune provides a stream of third-party applications that IT admins can use to deploy software updates to their users and devices. This stream is based on a catalog that was built and maintained by Microsoft. Additionally, Microsoft will host the binaries so that they can automate the creation of Intune applications further. IT admins worldwide spend excessive time duplicating their industry peers\u2019 work, packaging, and deploying the same third-party applications. This work never ends; IT admins must constantly monitor for individual updates released by software vendors. Enterprise App Management is Microsoft\u2019s latest effort to reduce the application management effort required of IT teams. Several solutions exist for Intune patch management, and it seems that Microsoft is finally entering the space with this new services add-on. What Applications Are in the Catalog? The first question many IT admins ask when reviewing a third-party patching product is how large the applicationcatalogis. The size of the Intune application catalog is a proxy for how many applications might match their environment and, thus, the amount of time the solution will save them. As of release, the Enterprise App Management catalog has 94 unique Windows applications, which are listed below. Note that Microsoft has committed to drastically increasing this number in the near future as well as including MacOS apps, so this list is likely outdated by the time you read this. 7-Zip [Igor Pavlov] Amazon AWS Tools for Windows [Amazon Web Services Developer Relations] Amazon Corretto 16 [Amazon] Amazon Kindle [Amazon] Android Studio 2022 [Android] Android Studio 3 [Android] Android Studio 4 [Android] Araxis Merge [Araxis] (2 Configurations) Artweaver Free [Boris Eyrich Software] Atomi Systems ActivePresenter [Atomi Systems, Inc.] Audacity [Audacity] Beyond Compare [Scooter Software, Inc.] Blender [Blender Foundation] (15 Configurations) BlueJeans 2 [Blue Jeans] (2 Configurations) Brady Workstation [Brady Corporation] Burp Suite Community Edition [PortSwigger] Burp Suite Professional Edition [PortSwigger] Calibre [Kovid Goyal] Cisco Jabber 14 [Cisco Systems, Inc.] Cisco Webex Meetings [Cisco Webex LLC] Cisco WebEx Recorder and Player [Cisco Webex LLC] Cisco WebEx Recording Editor [Cisco Webex LLC] Cisco Webex Teams [Cisco Systems, Inc.] Citrix Receiver [Citrix] Citrix Workspace app [Citrix] Citrix Workspace app LTSR [Citrix] CMake [2BrightSparks Ptd Ltd] (8 Configurations) Dell Command Update (Windows Universal Application) [Dell, Inc.] Docker Desktop [Docker Inc.] draw.io Desktop [draw.io] Duo Desktop [Duo Security Inc.] Eclipse Temurin JDK with Hotspot 11 (LTS) [Eclipse Foundation] Eclipse Temurin JDK with Hotspot 19 [Eclipse Foundation] Eclipse Temurin JRE with Hotspot 11 (LTS) [Eclipse Foundation] Eclipse Temurin JRE with Hotspot 19 [Eclipse Foundation] Egnyte Connect [Egnyte, Inc.] Egnyte WebEdit [Egnyte, Inc.] Evernote [Evernote] Foxit PDF Editor 11 [Foxit Software] Foxit PDF Editor 12 [Foxit Software] Foxit PDF Reader [Foxit Software] Frame App [Nutanix Inc.] Free Countdown Timer [Comfort Software Group] Google Chrome for Business [Google] Google Drive [Google] Inkscape [Inkscape] JAM Software TreeSize Free [JAM Software GmbH] KeePass Password Safe (Classic Edition) [Dominik Reichl] KeePassXC [KeePassXC] Lansweeper [Lansweeper] Lenovo Quick Clean [Lenovo Software] LogMeIn GoToMeeting IT Installer [LogMeIn] Microsoft .NET Runtime 6.0 [Microsoft] Microsoft Azure CLI [Microsoft] Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer [Microsoft] Microsoft Power BI Desktop [Microsoft] Microsoft PowerShell Core [Microsoft] (6 Configurations) Microsoft Skype for Desktop [Microsoft] Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business [Microsoft] Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable [Microsoft] Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable [Microsoft] Microsoft Visual Studio Code [Microsoft] Mozilla Firefox [Mozilla] (37 Configurations) Mozilla ThunderbirdMozilla] (29 Configurations) Nessus Agent 10 [Tenable, Inc.] Notepad++ [Don Ho] NVIDIA GeForce Experience [NVIDIA] OpenShot Video Editor [OpenShot Studios] OpenVPN [OpenVPN Technologies, Inc.] Oracle Java Runtime Environment Version 8 [Oracle] Parallels Client 18 [Parallels International GmbH] Piriform CCleaner [Piriform Ltd] Poll Everywhere [Poll Everywhere] Poly Lens Desktop App [Plantronics] Python 3.10 [Python Software Foundation] Python 3.11 [Python Software Foundation] QNAP Qsync [QNAP] R for Windows [R Core Team] Rarlab WinRAR [Rarlab] (27 Configurations) Remote Help [Microsoft] Royal TS 5 [code4ward.net e.U.] Royal TS 6 [code4ward.net e.U.] Royal TS 7 [code4ward.net e.U.] ScreenToGif [Nicke Manarin] Simon Tatham Putty [Simon Tatham] SyncBackFree [2BrightSparks Ptd Ltd] TeamSpeak client [TeamSpeak Systems] TechSmith Snagit 2019 [TechSmith Corporation] TechSmith Snagit 2020 [TechSmith Corporation] TechSmith Snagit 2021 [TechSmith Corporation] TechSmith Snagit 2023 [TechSmith Corporation] TechSmith Snagit 2024 [TechSmith Corporation] TightVNC [TightVNC] TortoiseSVN [TortoiseSVN] How Does Microsoft\u2019s Intune Patch Management Work The initial release of the Enterprise App Management tool for Intune is focused primarily on utilizing their updated catalog to pre-populate the application creation wizard. It\u2019s important to understand that EAM creates a regular Intune Win32 application; this is not a new app model. Any existing frustrations you may have with the existing app model (e.g., closing in-use apps and updating available apps) will not be solved by this new add-on. Let\u2019s walk through the process of deploying a new application for the first time. Creating the Initial Application In the Microsoft Intune portal, you navigate to Apps > Windows and click the Add button. This will open the \u2018Select App Type\u2019 flyout where you select \u2018Enterprise App Catalog app\u2019: This will begin the Add Application wizard where you click on \u2018Search the Enterprise App Catalog\u2019 to .. well \u2026 search the enterprise app catalog. This will trigger the search flyout where you can browse and search the catalog for the application you want to deploy: To begin creating the application, simply select the desired application and click Next. You will then be asked to select the specific configuration you wish to deploy. Most apps in the catalog only have a single configuration but some, like Firefox, have multiple languages, versions, or editions to select from: Once the application and configuration are selected the rest of the process follows the familiar workflow for adding a non-catalog application except that all of the metadata and detection rules are pre-populated for you: While the Microsoft Enterprise App Management service pre-populates the data, you can modify or customize the application in any way you see fit. If you need to change the command line, add an Icon (currently not pre-populated), or add additional detection rules you can do so. Deploying the Application Enterprise Application Management does not create deployments for the applications you create. Reviewing the workflow above, you will notice that, unlike other application sources, the Intune EAM wizard does not include a section for assigning the application. You will have to first complete the wizard, refresh the page waiting for the application to be created, and then edit the application properties to assign it to the desired users and devices. Installation Reporting Generally speaking, once the application is created, it behaves like any other Win32 application withinIntune. As such, the application will report installation status the same way any other Win32 application does: Updating Existing Applications Once you\u2019ve deployed the applications from Intune, you will be faced with what to do when new versions are released. Enterprise App Management handles updates in one of two ways. Self-Updating Applications Some applications within the catalog are considered self-updating. These applications have a built-in update mechanism that will be left enabled. The applications will automatically update themselves outside Microsoft Intune or the IT admin\u2019s control. The self-update mechanisms will download content directly from the vendor, so you must ensure that your network configuration allows access to these download locations. The app selection wizard will notify you when you select a self-updating app: Note that Microsoft Intune will report self-updating applications installed as long as they meet a minimum version requirement. You can see this at work by reviewing the Detection Rules: Non Self-Updating Applications Applications that do not self-update require that IT teams create and deploy each update app manually. The Enterprise App Management service includes a new blade in Microsoft Intune Apps called \u2018Updates for Windows (Win32) catalog apps\u2019. This blade will list catalog applications deployed in your environment that have newer versions available. The IT admin must regularly monitor this blade to review available updates to create and deploy the latest version as a new application. The IT admin can do this by clicking on the ellipsis (three dots) and selecting \u2018Update app.\u2019 When they do so, they will be brought through the same \u2018Add App\u2019 wizard shown above, with the addition of a supersedence section pre-populated with the previous catalog app(s). Note that you will still need to separately deploy this application by adding assignment post-creation. If you deployed the initial application as available, you are responsible for implementing a method for updating existing installations. A standard solution is to create two versions of the application: one that is available and another that is required but with an additional requirement that ensures the previous version is installed. How Does this Compare with Patch My PC? While we are certainly biased, we believe that Patch My PC\u2019s solutions deliver significant value beyond the current functionality of Microsoft Intune\u2019s Enterprise App Management. Pricing While possibly not the most important factor, many of our customers and potential customers will immediately notice a starkpricing disparity. Microsoft Intune\u2019s EAM is available standalone for $24/user/year or part of the Intune Suite for $120/user/year. By comparison, our Enterprise Plus SKU is priced at $3.5/device/year. One caveat here is that Patch My PC has a minimum starting price of $2,499 where-as Microsoft has no minimum. Organizations with less than 100 or so devices would have lower licensing costs. Though, as we will see below, that is very unlikely to equate to actual money saved. Catalog Size The second highest concern for most potential customers is the software update catalog, particularly the number of applications in it. In theory, the more extensive the catalog, the higher the number of apps you deploy. We caution against comparing these numbers without understanding how they are calculated. One early vendor in this space boasted 20k apps in their catalog; sounds amazing until you realize that this was the total number of updates they had published, not the number of unique applications. Many applications have separate x86 and x64 builds as well as MSI and EXE installers which instantly takes one app and makes it four. Some apps will have system installers versus user installers (ex. JetBrains ReSharper). Other apps will have multiple different versions currently in support (ex. Node.js). Throw in separate installers for languages and suddenly Firefox has 36 separate products, 72 if you include the Extended Support Release (ESR). At Patch My PC we\u2019re proud of our catalog and make it publicly searchable and even downloadable:Supported Products for ConfigMgr and Intune. As of writing, we have 1,383 individual products in our catalog representing all of the variants mentioned above which represent 969 unique products. It is worth noting that we have begun regularly removing deprecated applications from our catalog. Applications that have been abandoned by their authors or whose websites have been hijacked should not be deployed in an enterprise environment. It hurts our numbers, but it\u2019s the right thing to do, so we do it. By contrast, Microsoft\u2019s solution currently has 94 unique products and 212 individual products once multiple configurations are accounted for. These numbers are not easy to come by either. There is no publicly available list, and the only official way to get them is to sign up for a trial. It\u2019s important to note that the Microsoft Intune EAM product team has said, and we have reason to believe, that they will drastically increase this number. How much and how fast is unknown at this time and they are rather tight-lipped about it. Catalog Velocity While catalog size is the figure most potential customers focus on, the velocity of the catalog is equally important. How often is the catalog released, and how quickly are the latest versions of applications updated? The largest catalog in the world isn\u2019t worth a lot if it takes weeks for the latest security updates to appear in it. At the time of writing, Microsoft has not publicly provided any documentation or SLA to clarify this. However, we can glean information from the current state of their catalog. Here\u2019s a small sample of applications from Microsoft\u2019s catalog as of Feb 12, 2024 compared to the most recent versions available for those applications: Citrix Workspace AppCatalog version: 23.9.1 (Oct 31)Latest version: 23.11.1 (Feb 2) Catalog version: 23.9.1 (Oct 31) Latest version: 23.11.1 (Feb 2) Google Chrome for BusinessCatalog version: 119.0.6045.160 (Nov 23)Latest version: 121.0.6167.161 (Feb 6) Catalog version: 119.0.6045.160 (Nov 23) Latest version: 121.0.6167.161 (Feb 6) Mozilla FirefoxCatalog version: 121.0.1 (Jan 9)Latest version: 122.0.1 (Feb 6) Catalog version: 121.0.1 (Jan 9) Latest version: 122.0.1 (Feb 6) .NET Runtime 6.0 (x64)Catalog version: 6.0.25 (Nov 14)Latest version: 6.0.26 (Jan 9) Catalog version: 6.0.25 (Nov 14) Latest version: 6.0.26 (Jan 9) Zoom Client for Meetings (x64)Catalog version: 5.17.29988 (Jan 8)Latest version: 5.17.31030 (Jan 23) Catalog version: 5.17.29988 (Jan 8) Latest version: 5.17.31030 (Jan 23) It seems clear that it currently takes weeks, possibly months, for Microsoft to update the catalog with the latest version of a given application. Further, when EAM was publicly released on Feb 1st, it was released with outdated applications. In the case of the .NET Runtime 6.0 tool, the latest security release from within Microsoft itself is still unavailable a month after release. By comparison, each of the applications listed above had its latest version published in our catalog on the day the update was released. In some cases, like Google Chrome, we\u2019ve published multiple updates for a given application, while Microsoft has released none. At Patch My PC, we take this seriously. It\u2019s what we do. As such, we are clear and upfront about both our release cadence and how quickly we update apps. Here\u2019s what ourFAQhas to say about it:\u201cOur goal is to release updates the same day the vendor releases the update. We generally release our catalog between 1:00 \u2013 5:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time). You can review a full list of past catalog releases atcatalog release history. If a security update is released later in the afternoon, we oftenrelease two catalogs in a scenario where the update is a high-security risk. More minor non-security updates released later in the afternoon will be updated the following business day.\u201d Features As shown above, the main feature of EAM is that it pre-populates the Microsoft Intune App creation wizard. The application management process is still very manual; with the IT team responsible for managing and monitoring each application and software update. Patch My PC offers solutions thatfullyautomatethe process of updating existing applications. We can even detect currently unmanaged applications and automatically deploy updates for them to ensure that your environment stays secure. Our Publisher offers a litany of application customizations that you can automatically apply to apps and their updates. Popular features includecustom pre/post scriptsto handle complex installation requirements. Need to include an MSI transform or license file?We\u2019ve got you covered. Want a better user experience when updating an in-use application?Yea, we do that. Would you like granular control over when updates are deployed instead of apps self-updating whenever they feel like it?We got you fam. This just scratches the surface, for a more comprehensive list of features head over to ourfeature comparison page. Critically, these customizations are automatically applied to each new version of the application that we deploy. Want to add a custom installation parameter to the install or uninstall command-line? Great, do it one time and go find better ways to spend your time. Support We take particular pride in providing world-class technical support to our customers. We want every interaction our customers have with us to spark joy. Our founder and many others have years of experience in the systems management space. We\u2019ve lived that life, understand the pressures, and want to do all we can to make patching third-party applications a non-issue for you. Values Ourmission statementis: \u201cWe exist to improve lives, through customer-obsessed innovation. This encompasses making an impact on the lives of our customers, our team members, and the communities in which we live.\u201d We believe, possibly naively, that if we can deliver on this promise to our customers and ourselves, then success will follow. In Conclusion Microsoft saw a persistent gap for their customers and, after years of development, has released the first iteration of their Application Patch Management solution. While their initial offering is incomplete, they will continue to improve it. Here at Patch My PC, we welcome the competition and are confident that our current solutions offer significant value above and beyond those of Microsoft. We continue investing heavily in driving those solutions forward and continually seek to improve our customers\u2019 lives and help secure their organizations. We feel strongly that this is a winning strategy. Discover how PMPC can instantly resolve your Intune patch management headaches.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-11-hotpatch-rebootless-updates/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows 11 Hotpatch: RebootLess Updates Microsoft has recently introduced a mind-blowing feature calledHotpatch AKA Rebootless for Windows 11 Enterprise (version 24H2) and Windows 365 Enterprise.This feature allows quality updates to be applied without requiring a system restart, making it a game-changer for maintaining system availability while keeping devices secure. Why Windows 11 Hotpatch Updates are Useful Traditionally, updates requiring a restart can wreak havoc on workflows and productivity, especially in environments where continuous uptime is critical. Enter Hotpatching\u2014a game-changing solution that applies most updates seamlessly in the background, sparing end users from interruptions. While this dramatically reduces disruptions, periodic reboots are still required to maintain system stability. Typically, these are required only once every three months, cutting annual reboots from 12 to just 4\u2014a whopping 66% reduction! This approach minimizes downtime, boosts productivity, keeps systems secure, and ensures compliance with minimal disruption. Still, Hotpatching isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. Its undeniable benefits must be balanced with regular system maintenance to prevent performance degradation and ensure long-term stability\u2014don\u2019t let convenience breed complacency. In this blog, we\u2019ll walk you through configuring Hotpatching using Intune, unravel the architecture that powers this feature, and dive deep into how components like Usoclient and MoUSOCoreWorker (Modern Update Stack Orchestrator Core Worker) handle policies and deploy updates on Windows devices. By the end, you\u2019ll understand the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d behind this innovative update strategy. The WUFB-DS Hotpatch overview Let me show you the Hotpatch overview before zooming in on every building block one by one. We will first start with the easy part, which is configuring the Hotpatch policy in Intune. Configuring the Hotpatch Policy in Intune To enable Hotpatching, it\u2019s essential to ensure that all requirements are met. Here\u2019s what you need: A Microsoft Subscription: This includes Windows Enterprise E3 or E5 (e.g., Microsoft 365 A3/A5 or Microsoft 365 F3) or a Windows 365 Enterprise subscription. Targeted Devices: Devices must be running Windows 11 Enterprise (*LTSC) version 24H2 (Build 26100.2033 or later). Management Platform: Microsoft Intune is required \ud83d\ude42 to deploy and manage the Hotpatch policy. *LTSC: Please Note that Hotpatching only seems to kick in for the LTSC version (for now), as it seems there are no hotpatch-capable updates currently available for the regular Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2 release. Once you\u2019ve confirmed that all requirements are in place, you can proceed to configure the Hotpatching Update Policy in Intune. We can do so by creating a new Windows Quality Update Policy (preview) After selecting the new preview policy, we need to define some additional settings. Apply the latest cumulative quality updates for security: Enable this option to allow the system to fetch and apply the latest security updates. Apply the latest cumulative quality updates for security: Enable this option to allow the system to fetch and apply the latest security updates. When available, apply without restarting the device (\u2018hotpatch\u2019): Toggle this option to enable Hotpatching, which applies the updates without requiring a reboot. When available, apply without restarting the device (\u2018hotpatch\u2019): Toggle this option to enable Hotpatching, which applies the updates without requiring a reboot. After creating and assigning this policy to your devices, you may notice that syncing the device in Intune doesn\u2019t immediately reflect the changes. That\u2019s because the actual policy download and application process is handled by background services on the device itself(Usoclient and MoUSOCoreWorker), who communicate with the WUfB-DS API rather than the standard Intune sync mechanism. Once the device communicates with the API, we will notice that Windows Update now mentions that it will enable Hotpatching when available. Installing the Hotpatch capable Update With the policy configured, we can start checking the device for Windows updates. As shown below, after checking for updates, it mentions that the 2024-11 Windows 11 version 24h2 is HotPatch Capable and would start installing the update After installing the update, we even got a nice green bar telling us that we are NOT REQUIRED to reboot the device! It looks like pure magic! Except for the .net framework update, which still requires the device to reboot (sorry for the Dutch language)\u2026but we can\u2019t have it all, right?) Let\u2019s move on and dive into how this new Hotpatch Update policy arrives on our device. Windows Client Scheduled Tasks and Background Services The orchestration of retrieving the Hotpatching policy involves several moving parts on the Windows client. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the flow: 1. Scheduled Tasks Tasks like usoclient.exe start scan or other maintenance tasks trigger the Windows Update engine. Tasks like usoclient.exe start scan or other maintenance tasks trigger the Windows Update engine. These other Update Orchestration scheduled tasks ensure the system periodically checks for updates and applies policies when necessary. These other Update Orchestration scheduled tasks ensure the system periodically checks for updates and applies policies when necessary. 2. Usoclient and MoUSOCoreWorker Interaction Usoclient: Acts as the entry point. When triggered, it initiates a scan for updates and policies. (StartScan). This triggers the MoUSOCoreworker to wake up. Usoclient: Acts as the entry point. When triggered, it initiates a scan for updates and policies. (StartScan). This triggers the MoUSOCoreworker to wake up. MoUSOCoreWorker: This is where the real magic happens. It:Reads the store.db file (C:\\Programdata\\usoprivate\\updatestore\\store.db) to determine the last scan time and policy MoUSOCoreWorker: This is where the real magic happens. It: Reads the store.db file (C:\\Programdata\\usoprivate\\updatestore\\store.db) to determine the last scan time and policy Reads the store.db file (C:\\Programdata\\usoprivate\\updatestore\\store.db) to determine the last scan time and policy Validates the cached policy (ScanCache)against the current time to decide whether to fetch a new policy.

If the policy is outdated (or store.db is missing), it queries Windows Update Service API for the latest policy. If the policy is outdated (or store.db is missing), it queries Windows Update Service API for the latest policy. Detailed Component Workflow (Mermaid Flow Overview) Here\u2019s how the scheduled tasks, Usoclient, and MoUSOCoreWorker to retrieve the updatepolicy to make Hotpatching a reality: Detailed Explanation of the Mermaid Flow Here\u2019s a breakdown of the steps in the flowchart to help you understand how the Hotpatch feature operates in conjunction with Windows Update components: 1. Scheduled Task (Usoclient.exe start scan) The process begins when ascheduled taskor manual execution triggers usoclient.exe to start a scan (StartScan). This task ensures that the Windows Update process starts periodically or when requested. Purpose: To initiate a scan for updates, which includes fetching policies, determining the state of the system, and deciding on further actions. Purpose: To initiate a scan for updates, which includes fetching policies, determining the state of the system, and deciding on further actions. 2. MoUSOCoreWorker Execution Once the Usoclient starts the scan, theMoUSOCoreWorkertakes over. This component performs the heavy lifting, such as: Checking local policies and configurations. Checking local policies and configurations. Deciding whether a new policy fetch or update is required based on the scan delay and the local cache. Deciding whether a new policy fetch or update is required based on the scan delay and the local cache. Communicating with external Microsoft Update services if necessary. Communicating with external Microsoft Update services if necessary. Key Responsibility:MoUSOCoreWorkerdetermines whether the update process proceeds further by consulting the local store.db. 3. Database Logic TheMoUSOCoreWorkerchecks thestore.dbfile (stored in C:\\ProgramData) to understand the state of updates on the device: Check for the Last Scan Time: Check for the Last Scan Time: Determine Cached Policy Validity:The worker examines ScanCache and ScanAttemptTime entries in store.db to verify if the cached policy is still valid. Determine Cached Policy Validity: The worker examines ScanCache and ScanAttemptTime entries in store.db to verify if the cached policy is still valid. The worker examines ScanCache and ScanAttemptTime entries in store.db to verify if the cached policy is still valid. If the cached policy is valid, the system proceeds to apply it directly. If the cached policy is valid, the system proceeds to apply it directly. If the cached policy or store.db is invalid or missing, the system triggers a policy fetch. If the cached policy or store.db is invalid or missing, the system triggers a policy fetch. 4. Policy Fetch from devicelistenerprod If the cached policy is outdated or missing, theMoUSOCoreWorkercommunicates with theMicrosoft Update Servicethrough the endpoint devicelistenerprod.(GraphSync) The service responds with the latestUpdatePolicy JSON. What\u2019s in the JSON: This file includes update-related settings, such as whether Hotpatching is enabled, required update packages, and scheduling rules. What\u2019s in the JSON: This file includes update-related settings, such as whether Hotpatching is enabled, required update packages, and scheduling rules. A fun thing: If you have the token, you could also query the same API (or some others) with PowerShell. 5. Apply the Hotpatching Policy The fetched Update Policy JSON is then parsed and applied to the device. Specifically: Stored in store.db: The policy and metadata are cached locally for future reference. Stored in store.db: The policy and metadata are cached locally for future reference. Applied to the Windows Update Policy Manager: The policy is then applied to the system. We can spot the MoUSOCoreworker setting the AllowRebootless registry key in the Policymanager Key. When this key is set, we will notice that if we check the configured update policies, we will now spot the corresponding hotpatching policy. 6. Update Database After the policy is successfully applied, the following steps occur: Update the Last Scan Time: The ScanAttemptTime in store.db is updated to the current timestamp. Update the Last Scan Time: The ScanAttemptTime in store.db is updated to the current timestamp. Cache Metadata: Relevant details about the fetched policy are stored to ensure the system avoids redundant fetches in subsequent scans. Cache Metadata: Relevant details about the fetched policy are stored to ensure the system avoids redundant fetches in subsequent scans. 7. End Points The process has two possible outcomes: No Action (Do Nothing): If the scan delay hasn\u2019t been met or the cached policy is still valid, the system exits without making any network calls. No Action (Do Nothing): If the scan delay hasn\u2019t been met or the cached policy is still valid, the system exits without making any network calls. Policy Applied Successfully: The new policy is applied, updates proceed as per the policy, and the device remains compliant. Policy Applied Successfully: The new policy is applied, updates proceed as per the policy, and the device remains compliant. 8. A new, freshly enrolled device I need to make a small note here, because when you just enrolled a new device. The Hotpatch policy won\u2019t be delivered to your device immediately after enrollment. Depending on the timestamp of the OOBEComplete registry key, it will delay the policy retrieval. It ensures the device is in the perfect state to receive it. If you want to read the details, please read this additional blog https://patchmypc.com/oobe-complete-timestamp-wufb-hotpatch-delays The Hotpatching Policy Demo Words are only words, so let\u2019s take a look at a video in which I demonstrate how this policy is sent from the WUfB\u2014DS API endpoint when the orchestrator scheduled task is launched. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_uF1gH20QgA The MoUsoCoreWorker logs After looking at the flow and the explanation, you might wonder how I got all this information. It always starts with logs and Fiddler. To understand how this flow worked, I opened the ETL files from the C:\\Programdatausosharedlogssystem folder. After opening the existing ETL file with the WPA tool, it showed me the Orchestrator flow with the timestamps. This flow is pretty important! Why? Because after opening the mousocoreworker.exe with the IDA tool, things become very easy to spot The only thing I needed to do was examine the graphprovider::scan function to determine how and when the hotpatch UpdatePolicy was coming down to the device. Key Takeaways Policy Flow:While the policy configuration is initiated in Intune, its enforcement relies on the Windows Update components (Usoclient andMoUSOCoreWorker) on the Windows client. Intune primarily manages policy assignment, while the actual application of the policy occurs through the client\u2019s interaction with backend services, such as the Device Catalog (DCAT) and OneSettings endpoints. This separation allows for greater scalability and robustness as updates and policies are fetched and applied based on the client\u2019s schedule, ensuring seamless integration with existing workflows.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/constrained-language-mode-custom-detection/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Constrained Language Mode and Custom Detection Scripts AtPatch My PC (PMPC), ensuring seamless app deployment is a priority. During a recent Win32App deployment via Intune, a detection script failure highlighted the role of Constrained Language Mode (CLM) in restricting certain script executions. This post dives into how CLM can impact the Intune Custom detection scripts and how to manage it using AppLocker. Detection Rules When deployingWin32Appsin Intune, detection rules are critical for confirming successful installation. We automatically handle this at PMPC by generating detection scripts, simplifying the process for customers. The detection scripts are minified to reduce their size due to the size limitations of Intune policy payloads. For example, this is the detection script that is automatically created for the Simba Spark ODBC Driver In this case, the custom detection rule involved a PowerShell script containing: The Detection Rules Issue When the application is being installed, the detection rule\u2019s job is to verify if the application has been successfully installed. However, the custom detection script for the Win32App failed. To investigate further, we need to check theagentexecutor.log.This important log file is located in the Intune Management Extension folder. Upon review, we found this error message inside the agentexecutor.log. The term \u2018l\u2019 is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. After checking the Agentexecutor.log, we suspected thatConstrained Language Mode (CLM)was blocking the script\u2019s use of the .NET method FromBase64String. Why? Let me share some background information about CLM to get some understanding, about what was happening. Understanding Constrained Language Mode (CLM) Constrained Language Mode (CLM)is a PowerShell security feature that restricts the execution of certain features, such as custom .NET methods, COM objects, and dynamic types. Security policies such as AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) often enforce CLM to limit the risk posed by unauthorized or malicious scripts. In CLM, PowerShell allows basic cmdlets and operations while blocking the use of advanced scripting features. This mode is typically applied in environments where users need limited PowerShell functionality, but higher security is required. For example, scripts that rely on .NET methods like [Convert]::FromBase64String() will be blocked. Constrained Mode can be enforced at a per-user level through AppLocker or globally across a system. It ensures that untrusted scripts cannot access full PowerShell capabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation while maintaining administrative functionality. In summary, CLM is a powerful way to restrict PowerShell\u2019s execution environment. It enhances security by limiting scripts to essential operations unless they are explicitly trusted. Which language mode is PowerShell using? To verify if PowerShell is running inConstrained Language Mode, you can check the language mode by executing If the result is ConstrainedLanguage, CLM is active. If the result is FullLanguage mode, CLM is not active, and PowerShell runs in FullLanguage mode. With PowerShell Constrained Language Mode being active, the use of most .NET methods in the PowerShell session will be restricted, only allowing those explicitlydocumented by Microsoft. The method FromBase64String, which belongs to the .NET System.Convert class, is not included in the allowed types. Therefore, with CLM enabled, scripts using FromBase64String will be blocked. This means that the entire detection script, such as the one generated by Patch My PC (PMPC), will fail if it attempts to use this method, ultimately preventing the detection rule from running successfully. The Root Cause \u2013 Incorrect Configuration of CLM After spending some time on the case we noticed thatConstrained Language Modewas enabled system-wide. CLM can be activated by entering this command in your PowerShell session. This method applies the restriction system-wide, impacting bothuser and system contexts. This could lead to unintended side effects such as breaking the Win32app Detection rule. Instead, we recommend configuringAppLockerpolicies to manageConstrained Language Modemore selectively, applying it only where necessary. A Better Approach \u2013 Use AppLocker Powershell Constrained Language Mode Rather than enforcing CLM globally via thePSLockDownPolicyorusing PowerShell to enable CLM, a better approach is to useAppLockerto control script execution. AppLocker allows administrators to configurerulesthat manage whether a PowerShell script runs inFull Language ModeorConstrained Language Mode. By configuring AppLocker rules based on the script\u2019spublisher,you can allow specific scripts to run inFull Language Mode. This will grant them access to advanced PowerShell features without applying global restrictions, preventing detection failures while maintaining security. Let\u2019s discuss a bit how Applocker determines the language mode to fully understand why it could be a better approach. Applocker Powershell constrained language mode. WhenAppLockeris configured, PowerShell can run in eitherFull Language ModeorConstrained Language Modedepending on whether the script is trusted.Default AppLocker rulesenforceConstrained Language Modefor scripts unless they are explicitly allowed (e.g., through a certificate, path, or publisher rule). During startup, PowerShell checks the AppLocker policy using temporary PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1 and PSScriptPolicyTest*.psm1 files to determine the correct language mode. What is the _PSLockdownpolicy The PSLockdownPolicy is a system-wide setting in PowerShell that determines the level of restrictions applied to PowerShell scripts and commands. This policy directly controls thelanguage modeof PowerShell, affecting what users or scripts can execute within the environment. It is particularly relevant when security mechanisms likeConstrained Language Mode (CLM)are in place to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts. Here\u2019s an overview of the different lockdown policy levels: FullLanguage: No restrictions are applied to the PowerShell environment. Scripts can run with the full range of PowerShell commands and functionalities. FullLanguage: No restrictions are applied to the PowerShell environment. Scripts can run with the full range of PowerShell commands and functionalities. ConstrainedLanguage: A restricted mode in which only a subset of PowerShell cmdlets and operations is allowed. This mode is enforced primarily on systems with strict AppLocker or Device Guard configurations. It limits the execution of certain script types (e.g., .NET method calls like FromBase64String, which is a part of the .NET System.Convert Class) unless the script is signed or comes from a trusted source. ConstrainedLanguage: A restricted mode in which only a subset of PowerShell cmdlets and operations is allowed. This mode is enforced primarily on systems with strict AppLocker or Device Guard configurations. It limits the execution of certain script types (e.g., .NET method calls like FromBase64String, which is a part of the .NET System.Convert Class) unless the script is signed or comes from a trusted source. NoLanguage: This is the most restrictive mode, where no scripts or commands can be executed. Users can only run individual cmdlets interactively, but cannot write or execute any PowerShell scripts or expressions. NoLanguage: This is the most restrictive mode, where no scripts or commands can be executed. Users can only run individual cmdlets interactively, but cannot write or execute any PowerShell scripts or expressions. RestrictedLanguage: Similar to NoLanguage, it severely limits what can be executed but allows basic, built-in commands. RestrictedLanguage: Similar to NoLanguage, it severely limits what can be executed but allows basic, built-in commands. PSLockdownPolicy is usually configured with a PowerShell script from Intune to enforce security policies on a system. PowerShell queries this policy to determine the allowed execution environment. It\u2019s commonly used in environments where security and prevention of script-based attacks are crucial. Important: Do not create an Applocker rule to allow the PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1 files. This could unintentionally bypass security and allow all scripts to run inFull Language Mode, defeating the purpose of CLM. Solving the Detection Script Issue In our case, the detection script failed becauseCLMblocked the use of the .NET method FromBase64String. To fix this, we advise removing the global PSLockDownPolicy / CLM setting and instead adding an AppLocker rule that allows the detection script to run inFull Language Mode. With Applocker configured to restrict the execution PowerShell, it\u2019s best practise to configure a code-signing certificate in the PMPC console, to digitally sign the detection scripts. Please Note:When usingIntune Apps for Patch My PC Cloud, the detection scripts are signed by default. To get the details needed for the AppLocker rules whitelist, go to a win32 app published through the PMPC Cloud portal. Once there, save the detection script as a .ps1 file and check the Properties of the newly saved file. You can view the Digital Signature and the certificate used to sign the script. Adding the publisher to our existing Applocker Policy With the Detection scripts digitally signed, we could configure an Applocker rule to ensure the detection scripts are always allowed (even in user mode). The AppLocker rule below was configured based on the script\u2019s publisher, ensuring that the detection script could bypass CLM restrictions without compromising system security. After adding the Patch My PC published toour Applocker policy, we can export this Applocker rule and add it to the existing Applocker PowerShell scripts policy (UTF-8). By adding this publisher to our Applocker policy, we can ensure that the custom detection script can always be executed without any barriers. If you want to learn more about Applocker and how we could configure a pretty secure baseline, feel free to read this blog post. It will guide you through configuring the Applocker policy from scratch. If you don\u2019t want to build it from scratch, you could also use some automation to deploy the Applocker baseline I put together. Deploy Applocker to Intune with PowerShell (call4cloud.nl) Summary \u201cWhen deploying Win32Apps in Intune, Constrained Language Mode (CLM) can interfere with detection scripts that depend on restricted methods. Instead of enforcing global CLM restrictions, a more effective approach is to use AppLocker to selectively allow trusted scripts to run in Full Language Mode while maintaining strong security controls. Our goal is not to compromise security but to strike the right balance. By configuring AppLocker (or WDAC) policies, you can restrict PowerShell scripts to only those digitally signed with a trusted code-signing certificate. This approach ensures functionality without sacrificing protection. At Patch My PC, we automate detection rules to simplify deployments, but it\u2019s essential to have the proper configurations in place to ensure smooth app deployments and maintain a secure environment.\u201d Free Trial Schedule Demo Schedule a Setup Call Schedule a Q&A Call ROI Calculator Advanced Insights Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC Publisher Home Updater CVE Insights PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) MEM Patching Optimizer About Us Careers Events & Webinars Customer Reviews Contact Us Call Us: 1 800 250 2334 FAQs Knowledge Base Catalog Release History Product Documentation Release Notes Partners & Resellers Feature Request Product Roadmap Patch Tuesday Blog Patch My PC Blog Support Forum Supported Products"}
{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/managing-edge-browser-extensions-like/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Managing Edge Browser extensions like your app deployments, using PSAppDeployToolkit Have you ever tried to deploy different Microsoft Edge extensions to different devices via GPO/Intune policies? If the answer is yes, you\u2019ll know that Edge and Intune / GPO policies are not a match made in heaven. Let me explain how Edge Extension policies and thePSAppDeployToolkitare a match made in heaven. Edge extension policies such asExtensionInstallForceListcreate numbered lists in the registry containing URLs and related settings. As soon as you need to install different extension settings on different devices, you might have to replicate and and keep in sync the content of the extension policy lists in multiple policies. In larger environments where there can be multiple combinations of extensions needed on various devices, it starts to get unwieldy. We created a simple solution to overcome this challenge with thePSAppDeployToolkitby enabling Edge Extensions to be deployed and managed like applications. Some of the benefits of managing Edge extensions like applications are that extensions can be: Managed individually and not part of an entire policy set of extensions Installed and uninstalled like applications Targeted to users or devices Added as dependencies of applications or an application deployment group can be added as a member of the extension deployment group Published in the same catalog as applications, e.g. Company Portal Edge Policy Management Overview Before we jump into the solution, it\u2019s important to know that Extensions policies can be managed in different ways; 1. Intune / GPO Policy Management Policies apply to managed devices only. Policies apply to all Edge profiles on the device. 2. Edge Management Service (M365 Admin Center) Policies apply to managed and unmanaged devices. Policies follow the user irrespective of the device (corporate or personal) Policies only apply to the managed Edge profile, so users can circumvent corporate policies and install extensions in a separate Edge profile. Neither solution solves the problem of deploying different extensions on different devices. Intune/GPO policy management has the advantage that it will apply to all profiles on the device. EMS has the advantage of controlling policies on unmanaged devices, which might be useful for scenarios such as MAM for Edge. For our purposes, we are focussed on the managed device scenario. Why is this relevant? The solution we developed in PSADT is applicable to Intune/GPO management scenarios. It cannot be used in conjunction with extensions configured in EMS because EMS leverages the sameExtensionSettingsregistry key, which will, therefore, conflict. Edge Extension Deployment with PSAppDeployToolkit TheConfigure-EdgeExtensionfunction that was released inPSAppDeployToolkit v3.10.1leverages EdgeExtensionSettings, which is a JSON string specifying the extensions and their settings to be configured. By individually adding and removing extensions from this JSON construct we can manage extensions like applications. The benefit of using ExtensionSettings is that it takes precedence overExtensionInstallForcelist,ExtensionInstallAllowlistandExtensionInstallBlocklistpolicies, so these settings can co-exist side-by side with the extensions deployed by policy. As an example, you can have a GPO or Intune policy that uses ExtensionInstallForceList to push mandatory extensions for all devices and alongside that you can push specific extensions to a subset of devices using ExtensionSettings. Using ExtensionSettings also offers more configuration options. Here is an example of the ExtensionSettings JSON used to install an extension: You can see the policies applied to a device by opening Edge and navigating to edge://policy, then locate the policies related to extensions. The screenshot below shows an example of policies configured with the following: All extensions are blocked by default using\u201cExtensionInstallBlocklist\u201d. One extension is allowed for users to install using\u201cExtensionInstallAllowlist.\u201d One extension is force installed using\u201cExtensionInstallForcelist\u201d One extension is force installed using\u201cExtensionSettings\u201d(method used by PSAppDeployToolkit) You can navigate to edge://extensions to see the extensions installed on a device. Extensions force-installed using either the policy or PSAppDeployToolkit\u2019s method will appear as locked and \u201cManaged by your organization\u201d. The following screenshot shows what each method looks like: Using Configure-EdgeExtension You can deploy Edge extensions using PSAppDeployToolkit by doing the following. Download a copy of PSAppDeployToolkit. You can find the latest releasehere Extract the downloaded archive and copy the Toolkit folder into a new location. This is, essentially, creating a new deployment using a standard deployment template Open the `Deploy-Application.ps1` script and update the Initialization section with an `AppVendor`, `AppName` and `AppVersion` Add the following code to the relevant script sections, substituting with the correct `ExtensionID` The `UpdateURL` should contain the location where the extension should be installed from and should be set as follows:Microsoft Edge Add-ons store \u2013 `https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx`Chrome Web Store \u2013 `https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`Other \u2013 Use the URL where Edge can download the packed extension (.crx file) Microsoft Edge Add-ons store \u2013 `https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx` Chrome Web Store \u2013 `https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx` Other \u2013 Use the URL where Edge can download the packed extension (.crx file) Once you\u2019ve created your application in Intune, you\u2019ll need to use a detection method to verify if the extension has been installed successfully. The following script will do this. You\u2019ll need to configure the `$extensionID` variable: One more thing \u2026Extension manifest v2 deprecation It\u2019s important to note that in all Chromium-based browsers (including Microsoft Edge), Manifest v2 extensions will soon bedisabled]. Below is an overview of the phase-out timeline published on theChromewebsite: At the time of publishing this post, Microsoft have not yet confirmed a timeline forEdge. The latest statement from Microsoft is that *\u201dManifest V2 extensions will continue to be supported through Enterprise policies at least until the date in the Chromium Manifest V2 support timeline\u201d and \u201cThe Microsoft Edge team is currently in the process of updating this MV3 migration timeline\u201d*. Although is a little bit vague, it\u2019s good to get ahead of this. You can get another year of support and ensure those extensions are exempt until June 2025 by configuring theExtensionManifestV2Availabilitypolicy to either of the following values: 2 = Manifest v2 is enabled 3 = Manifest v2 is enabled for forced extensions only The following script will report on all the extensions installed in the current user\u2019s profile including the manifest version. With this, you can discover which extensions are still running manifest v2: To gather data on all extensions in your organization, consider using the Configure-EdgeExtensions function to bulk install all extensions identified from your organization\u2019s policies on a test device, then run this script to get the manifest version details. Another approach could be to deploy this script as an Intune Remediation run in the user context and output the data to Log Analytics to get a view of all Extension manifest versions across your estate. Conclusion Having the ability to manage Edge Extensions like applications can simplify the job of an IT Admin and provide your customers with more flexibility. Edge Extension Manifest v2 deprecation is approaching, so don\u2019t forget to take care of business and prevent broken extensions.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-server-2025-installcalypse/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows Server 2025 Installcalypse?! There\u2019s been a series of threads on social media with alarm-raising titles like \u2018Windows Server 2022 Servers Unexpectedly Upgrading to Server 2025\u2014Help!\u2018 For any system administrator, the sudden appearance of Windows Server 2025 on your 2022 servers is understandably concerning. But let me say up front: if you\u2019re using Microsoft\u2019s management tools to handle server updates, you\u2019re in the clear and won\u2019t be impacted by this unexpected upgrade. What Happened? On November 2, 2024, Microsoft officially released Server 2025 as Generally Available. Earlier in the year, Microsoft released a video discussing the available upgrade paths to 2025:Windows Server 2025: The upgrade and update experience. In that video, they announced that Feature Updates would be available to facilitate in-place upgrades. Arguably, a video is not a particularly prominent way to announce a change of this magnitude. I can find no other reference to this important change anywhere else but this video. I\u2019m also somewhat lazy, though, so take that for what it\u2019s worth. When the Feature Updates were made available for Server 2025, the Windows Update UI started offering them as optional updates on Server 2022, similar to its Windows 11 counterpart: Ok, What Went Wrong? The release of Feature Updates for the Windows Server OS has caught a small number of third-party Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools off guard. Their software or their customers\u2019 configurations were not prepared for the release of a Feature Update for the Server OS to Windows Update. The circumstances are RMM dependent, but the effect was the same: the RMMs installed the Server 2025 Feature Update automatically. What makes this particularly disastrous is two separate things. First, unlike Windows 10 and 11 FUs, there\u2019s no rollback option. You do not have 10 days to \u2018seamlessly\u2019 revert to the previous OS. If you don\u2019t have a full OS backup to restore from, your only option is to rebuild the OS. But ok, maybe you just had your Server 2025 rollout accelerated. It\u2019s a feature, not a bug! This brings us to the second problem: the new Server 2025 install will no longer be activated if you use OEM or retail licenses. This leaves admins between a rock and a hard place: you can\u2019t go back and don\u2019t have licenses for what you moved to. And that\u2019s only if you got lucky: the FU left you with a working OS. The key thing to understand here is that this only impacts users of a small subset of non-Microsoft management tools. If you use WSUS, ConfigMgr, Azure Update Management, or GPOs to configure and manage updates on your Windows Servers, you willnotexperience Server 2025 installing outside of an administrator\u2019s intent. Yes, allowing users to log into the server\u2019s desktop and click \u2018Download and Install\u2019 will let them do that. But not before a further prompt that they must accept that makes clear-ish that there could be licensing implications. While that\u2019s admittedly not great, if you\u2019re letting rando\u2019s remote to the desktop of your servers they\u2019re basically administrators at that point. Why Does Microsoft Always Screw This Up? Hold up there, killer; let\u2019s put the pitch-forks away for a second. Several commentators threw Microsoft under the bus for releasing a faulty patch. While I can appreciate how one would be predisposed to such a take, I believe that\u2019s rolling out the Jump-To-Conclusions mat. Whether you agree or not, Microsoft\u2019s strategic direction is \u2018the cloud.\u2019 Organizations that have moved to Intune are looking at their remaining WSUS/ConfigMgr infrastructure they\u2019re keeping around to support servers and looking for the offramp to the cloud. EnterAzure Update Manager(AUM): Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based solution to manage the updates offered to Servers from the cloud (Windows Update). There\u2019s no cloud-based imaging solution for servers, so Microsoft did the only thing it could do: release Feature Updates for server operating systems via Windows Update. I\u2019ve also seen accusations that Microsoft somehow screwed up the release of the update by getting the metadata wrong. The source for this is that the Feature Update is assigned KB5044284, which the Microsoft Update Catalog shows only a Cumulative Update for Server 2025 (24H2): The theory seems to be that this is really a Feature Update that is so messed up that it\u2019s somehow applying to Server 2022. That has to be it, right? It says KB5044284 right there! BOOM! Headshot! No It\u2019s taken me years to understand two things: KBs do not equal updates, and there is no single source of truth for updates. First, a KB is just that, a Knowledge Base article. Nothing more, nothing less. There are KBs with no updates, KBs with a single update, and KBs with multiple updates for disparate products and systems. Yes, nearly every Microsoft update has a KB assigned to it, but tracking the relation from KB to Update is frustrated by my second point: there\u2019s no single source of truth for Windows/Microsoft updates. Nor is there any official public API for any of this! Crazy, but true! This means that just because only three updates are listed in the Update Catalog (see screenshot above), it doesnotfollow that there areonlythree updates associated with KB5044284. It simply means that only those three are published through thatparticularchannel: the Update Catalog. How can you check to see if they\u2019re available from other channels, such as Windows Update or WSUS? You don\u2019t. You cannot know what\u2019s in those channels unless MS has a page that tells you or you observe it being delivered by said channel. There are Four Updates! What really happened here is that in addition to the three updates shown above, Microsoft has also published a Feature Update for Server 2025 to the Windows Update channel. Further, as they have begun doing with Windows 11, Microsoft appears to be planning to release new Feature Updates every month that include the latest Cumulative Update. This explains why the Feature Update was assigned KB5044284: because it includes the quality and security fixes included in that KB. Lastly, there have been accusations that Microsoft classified the Feature Update as a Security update, which fooled some RMMs. Getting to the bottom of this is difficult because, as stated above, there\u2019s no source of truth and there\u2019s no API to query the Windows Update channel. What youcando is investigate devices that are offering the Feature Update. After far too much time practicing certain dark arts, you can tease out information about the updates that the Windows Update Agent determines apply to that device. This gives us the following information: Update ID:88285020-3ed0-4f3f-90c7-d2fa3581bd7fTitle:Windows Server 2025Description:Install Windows Server 2025Classification:3689bdc8-b205-4af4-8d4a-a63924c5e9d5 (Upgrade)KB:5044284This is essentially the smoking gun. It is a Feature Update classified as an Upgrade, available from Windows Update, and assigned KB5044284. Windows Server 2025 Installcalypse Conclusion As stated initially, if you use Microsoft technologies to manage server updates, you won\u2019t be impacted by this recent brouhaha. If you are affected, know that the fault likely lies with your chosen RMM tool or its update settings. While it\u2019s easy to point fingers at Microsoft when updates go awry, this time, they got it right. However, managing updates extends beyond just OS upgrades\u2014keeping applications current is vital for security and stability. That\u2019s where Patch My PC comes in.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-management-extension-uninstallation-protection/", "title": "", "raw_text": "The Intune Management Extension: Uninstallation Protection Have you ever wondered what keeps theIntune Management Extension (IME)secure from accidental or unauthorized uninstallation? If you thought certificates were just about enrollment and secure communication, think again! In this blog, we will uncover a hidden layer of protection that ensures only authorized devices can uninstall the IME, keeping your devices securely managed. Let\u2019s explore the IME\u2019s uninstallation protection mechanism, breaking down how certificates validate device integrity and tenant flighting ensures controlled feature access. Introduction In my previous blog, we explored theIntune Management Extension (IME) Cert Checker in depth, uncovering its key role in ensuring certificates are in place to keep devices communicating securely with Intune. While investigating that process, I stumbled upon something unexpected, something that adds a whole new twist to the story. So, what\u2019s going on? It turns out that certificates aren\u2019t just for keeping devices enrolled; they also play a critical part in uninstalling the Intune Management Extension itself! Let\u2019s zoom in on how this works. Why Uninstallation Protection Matters Before we dive into the technical flow, let\u2019s consider why controlling IME uninstallation is so important. If the IME were removed unintentionally or without proper authorization, devices could lose their management capabilities, leaving them non-compliant and potentially vulnerable. This could disrupt device configurations, jeopardize security baselines, or even expose sensitive data. That\u2019s why Microsoft implemented a robust mechanism to ensure only authorized removals occur. How the IME Picks Up the Uninstall Policy Behind the scenes, the IME relies on several core components to manage uninstallation policies. When the EmsAgentService starts, it registers the SideCarUninstallationPlugin with the PolicyProcessor, which is responsible for managing policies on the device. The ChannelUriInfoRetriever component then retrieves all necessary policies from Intune, including the policy related to uninstallation. This information is essential to determining whether the device is authorized to uninstall the IME. The Uninstallation Plugin: Certificates Play a Bigger Role Than You Think Here\u2019s where things get interesting. Certificates aren\u2019t just involved in keeping devices enrolled; they also play a key role in uninstalling the Intune Management Extension (IME). Before any uninstallation happens, the SideCarUninstallationPlugin ensures that: The device has a valid certificate. The device has a valid certificate. The tenant is not flighted to prevent uninstallation. The tenant is not flighted to prevent uninstallation. This dual-layer check ensures that only properly authorized devices and tenants can trigger the uninstallation process, preventing unintended or unauthorized removal of the IME. Tenant Flighting for Uninstallation Protection Tenant flighting adds an extra layer of security by controlling which tenants are allowed to uninstall the IME. Inside the SideCarUninstallationPlugin code, the tenant flighting mechanism checks whether uninstallation is permitted. If the tenant is configured to block uninstallation, the process halts, ensuring that the IME remains active on the device. This mechanism plays a critical role in maintaining device compliance and security. By restricting uninstallation to specific scenarios, Microsoft ensures that only devices managed under the correct policies can execute this operation. Valid Certificates and Controlled Uninstallation Protection Uninstallation can only proceed if the tenant allows it and the device has a valid certificate. This process involves the same certificate validation steps used during regular device operations, ensuring secure communication and compliance. Certificates act as a gatekeeper, verifying device identity and authorization before allowing the uninstallation process to continue. By requiring valid certificates, the IME ensures that only authorized devices can proceed with uninstallation. This safeguards against accidental or unauthorized removal, reinforcing the device\u2019s compliance and keeping management intact without unnecessary risks. The Flow To summarize the uninstall protection process: The EmsAgentService starts and registers the SideCarUninstallationPlugin. The EmsAgentService starts and registers the SideCarUninstallationPlugin. The PolicyProcessor manages the uninstallation policy retrieved by the ChannelUriInfoRetriever. The PolicyProcessor manages the uninstallation policy retrieved by the ChannelUriInfoRetriever. The system checks tenant flighting to determine if uninstallation is allowed. The system checks tenant flighting to determine if uninstallation is allowed. Certificate validation ensures the device\u2019s identity and authorization. Certificate validation ensures the device\u2019s identity and authorization. Only when all checks pass does the uninstallation proceed. Only when all checks pass does the uninstallation proceed. Conclusion The IME uses a tightly controlled process to ensure that uninstallation only happens when it\u2019s fully authorized. The interaction between the SideCarUninstallationPlugin, PolicyProcessor, and Cert Checker creates a secure environment where uninstallation is only possible when all the checks align.

One common mistake we see is when customers create adeployment package,they specify theWSUSContentfolder and the deployment package source. If the WSUSContent folder is specified as the package source, ConfigMgr will automatically delete all the third-party update content published to the WSUSContent folder causing updates tofail to downloadinto a deployment package.

Note from Microsoft Docs:Decide whether to add software updates to a new or existing software update group. In most cases, choose to create a new software update group when the ADR runs. If the rule runs on a more aggressive schedule, you might choose to use an existing group. For example, if you run the rule daily for definition updates, then you could add the software updates to an existing software update group.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intro-wbemtest/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Introduction to WBEMTEST What is WBEMtest? WBEMtest is a Windows Management Instrumentation Tester tool built into all Windows NT based operating systems. It provides a graphical interface to WMI and its capable of performing the following tasks: Enumerate, open, create, and delete WMI classes. Enumerate, open, create, and delete WMI instances. Query WMI data using a SQL like syntax (WQL). Execute methods declared on instances or classes. Remote access to WMI providers. What is WMI? Without getting too far off the topic of this blog, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a Microsoft implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM). WBEM is an industry standard for accessing and managing information in an enterprise environment. WMI relies on Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or DCOM to create WMI connections. Having a working understanding of WMI in important to understand the function of WBEMtest. You can read more about WMI and its architecturehere. What are the WBEMtest use cases? WBEMtest can be used in a wide variety of WMI interactions. Many modern applications, including Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, rely on the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for essential functions. WBEMtest can be a useful tool in the troubleshooting/debugging of those applications such as ensuring the health of the WMI provider/repository, validate correct access permissions on namespaces or instance data, and testing WMI connectivity. Other use cases include: Querying application-specific namespaces to verify data stored within the repository. Manually invoke application-specific methods declared on classes or instance data. Test for or gather more detailed information for error messages emitted from the WMI provider. Explore WMI namespaces to understand schemas defined by an application in the repository. Build useful WMI queries. Ensuring the Windows Management Instrumentation Windows Service is running on the local or remote computer. Ensuring the correct firewall rules are enabled for remote WMI connection. How to use WBEMtest? Since WBEMtest is part of the Windows family of operating systems it can be started by simply typing \u2018WEBMtest\u2019 into the start menu or into Run. If a remote host is unavailable, you will receive an error message with specific details about the error. This is useful when trying to troubleshoot a potentially broken provider. In this example, we will use WBEMtest to execute a WQL query on a remote host in the rootcimv2 namespace. Type \u2018wbemtest\u2019 into the start menu to launch WBEMtest. Fill in the namespace field with the host and namespace and click \u2018Connect\u2026\u2019 to connect to the local computer or remote host. Here you can optionally input user credentials. All UI controls should become active. From here you can enumerate classes and instances, perform Create or Delete operations, query using WQL, execute methods, or invoke a number of other functions. Click on the \u2018Query\u2026\u2019 button to enter a WMI query. Run an example query from cimv2 to enumerate instance data and click \u2018Apply\u2019. The query syntax is WQL (Windows Management Instrumentation Query Language) and is very similar to SQL queries. The object editor is a powerful tool that allows you to edit the schema and instance data. It is a common window to see throughout WBEMtest. You\u2019ll want to exercise caution here as making edits can potentially break applications which rely on it. Also note you can Add/Edit/Delete method declarations in a schema. How can WBEMtest help troubleshoot Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager? The cool thing with WBEMtest is that it can be used to troubleshoot, view, or execute on data that exists within the site server or its clients. Site server data will be housed in ROOTSMS or client data in ROOTccm. Using WBEMtest to verify connection to either of these WMI namespaces provides useful information during troubleshooting issues with a site server or client. I\u2019ve frequently used WBEMtest to test WMI connectivity to a client using the site server account or the client installation account. I\u2019ll go over a couple of examples of its usefulness in managing Configuration Manager clients. Example 1 \u2013 Get a list of deployed applications Suppose you\u2019ve deployed a new application, and you suspect a client has not received the advertisement for some reason. You can use WBEMtest to connect to the remote computer to verify if CCM client has received the new deployment. Use the steps above to connect to the remote machine under the \u2018root\\CCM\\ClientSDK\u2019 namespace. Next, we will want to enumerate instances of the class CCM_Application. Click on the \u2018Enum Instances\u2019 button and enter CCM_Application as the superclass name. In this example there are two applications that are deployed to this machine. They show up as separate instances of the CCM_Application class. You can double-click an instance to bring up the application deployment metadata via the object editor. If an application is missing from this list which you know you have deployed to this client, then we know a potential problem may exist. The client may have simply not yet invoked an application deployment evaluation cycle, the client may be unhealthy, or another underlying problem may exist. Alternately, if you wish to perform some action on an application deployment, there are a number of methods attached to CCM_Application which can be invoked. Example 2 \u2013 Run a CCM client action So now you\u2019ve determined the first step would be to force refresh the machine policy and run an application deployment policy. While it is true you can do this on a client from the Configuration Manager console, we want to invoke it from WMI using WBEMtest! All the actions that exist within the CCM client \u2018Actions\u2019 tab are backed by a corresponding WMI method on the SMS_Client class instance. There are also several more actions that can be invoked outside of what is available in the CCM client \u2018Actions\u2019 tab or the context menu in Configuration Manager. Connect to a client with WBEMtest using the steps above. Connect to the \u2018rootccm\u2019 namespace. Click on \u2018Execute Method..\u2019, enter in the class name \u2018SMS_Client\u2019 and click \u2018OK\u2019. A number of methods are selectable and executable from the drop-down list. Select EvaluateMachinePolicy and click \u2018Execute\u2019.The most versatile method available in \u2018SMS_Client\u2019 is the ;riggerSchedule; method. It will allow you to invoke a number of client actions by passing a ScheduleId to the method as a parameter. A full list of ScheduleIds is availablehere. As an example, we will invoke an Application Deployment evaluation. Select the \u2018TriggerSchedule\u2019 method on SMS_Client. This method requires parameters. Click on \u2018Edit In Parameters\u2026\u201d to open the object editor. Find \u2018sScheduleId\u2019 property and click the \u2018Edit Property\u2019 button. Click the \u2018Not NULL\u2019 radio button and enter in the appropriate ScheduleId then click \u2018Save Property\u2019. This will take you back to the Object editor. Click the \u2018Save Object\u2019 button to save the parameter set. Click the \u2018Execute\u2019 button on the \u2018Execute Method\u2019 window. Summary Hopefully this demonstrates how WBEMtest is a useful tool for troubleshooting, querying data, validating data, and executing actions. Best of all: it is built into every recent Microsoft operating system. For those who run Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager sites, this tool is highly valuable to troubleshoot or interact with site servers, components, and clients. There are many Configuration Manager actions/data that is exposed through WMI and tools to interact with it become invaluable to a Systems Administrator.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/quality-updates-oobe-autopilot/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Quality updates during the out-of-box experience In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the newQuality updatesintroduced in theout-of-box experience (OOBE),also known as theWindows Update Experience (NDUP), in the latest Windows build. With these enhancements, once a device finishes the Windows Autopilot Device Preparation Enrollment (OOBE), it will automatically update to the latest version and security build Windows UpdateIntroduction Ensuring your devices are up to date is pretty important, particularly during device enrollment. Windows Autopilot\u2019s initial concept was to ship the device directly from the supplier to the end user, a process that can present significant challenges with older Windows Builds. One of the major issues here was that most of the time, those devices weren\u2019t up to date and lacked the latest security updates. Sometimes, those devices were almost one year behind on updates. Microsoft\u2019s support cycle ensures that devices receive timely security updates, which is crucial for maintaining compliance and security. Having a device that is not up to date could potentially expose it to security issues and vulnerabilities, and I guess we don\u2019t want those. From the compliance side, we could also define a compliance policy to ensure that only up-to-date devices can access our corporate data. If a device has an older build than what\u2019s inside your compliance policy, you need to update those devices as soon as possible; otherwise, you will lose access. Luckily, Microsoft seems to be working on something. I noticed something new after discovering the local administrator Windows Autopilot Device Preparation bug. Let me tell you what I saw! Once the device was successfully enrolled and all the applications published by Patch My Pc were installed, I clicked on next, expecting to get prompted for Windows Hello for Business(Wh4B).Something else happened! Quality Updates During out-of-box experience (NDUP) Once the device finished installing all the third-party apps provided by PMPC, I was expecting to be prompted for WHfB, but somehow, it didn\u2019t. Instead of the WH4B screen, it showed methis brand-new Quality Updates During out-of-box experience. The first screen told me that\u201can update was in progress. We\u2019ll take it from here\u201d. Users receive a notification prompting them an update is in progress. After that initial new Windows Update screen, it also switched to another brand-new Update screen. This new screen showed the download progress of the Windows Update it was trying to install. Just asPatch My PCensures that Applications are kept up to date, Microsoft now ensures that Windows devices receive timely updates to protect against security vulnerabilities after the Windows Autopilot device Preparation enrollment. In addition to this new Update window, it also showed us an option to cancel features and security updates. Let\u2019s look at how it looks when we combine those screens I showed you! As shown above, this flow looks pretty good and could fix our device\u2019s lack of security vulnerability updates after enrollment. Of course, we could ask the user to download the updates themselves, but wouldn\u2019t it be nicer to have the option to deploy them during Oobe after the Windows Autopilot Device Preparation Enrollment? Let\u2019s explore andinvestigate how Microsoft appears to be experimenting with a new update featurecalledOobeOngoingSoftwareUpdateStatus,and how they implemented this feature to be executed after the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment. Oobe Ongoing Software Update Status To find out how this newOobeOngoingSoftwareUpdateStatusfeature works from the inside, we first need to take a brief tour through theMicrosoft Cloud Experience Hostand the correspondingOobe code.Let\u2019s start with zooming into this new Quality Updates During out-of-box experience. Once your Windows Autopilot Device Preparation flow is finished, press next to accept the privacy settings. Once you agree to the terms, in the background, we will notice that theCloudExperienceHostwill try to discover (discovery.js) which features are enabled on the device and which capabilities are supported. ExpediteUpdatePILessfeature TheCloudExperienceHostwill check if theExpediteUpdatePILessfeature is enabled. If so, it will add theosRevisionto the headers. From there on, it will navigate tosdx.microsoft.com(which is a weird url if you ask me). I assume it serves its purpose. If this URL is reachable, the Cloud Experience host will initialize the configuration and switch to a regular \u201cChecking For Updates\u201d window. Behind this existing screen, a lot of magic is happening because, with the latest Windows Insider build (26100) 24h2, Microsoft added a nice new feature calledOobeNdupOngoingUpdateStatus. OobeNdupOngoingUpdateStatus. With some other features added in a previous build (26040.1000), those new Update and Oobe features will enable something unique. With these Oobe NDUP features enabled, If an update is found, it will switch to the NDUP ongoing updates status experience. And now you are pretty much wondering whatNDUPis, right? NDUP is the Windows 11 rollout andupdate promotion for new devices(NDUP/New Devices Update Promotion). Using NDUP will result in a smooth customer experience and speed up the adoption ofWindows 11 upgrades.Sounds like a great update experience, right? Let\u2019s move on to what will happen when this feature is enabled. To enable theNDUP expedited update, a registry key will be created just before the new Windows Update promotion/experience screen is shown. Once the expedited update is enabled, you will receive the much-anticipated new Update window. Your Update is in Progress This new Update flow provides a streamlined and efficient way to manage and install critical updates, ensuring your system remains secure and up-to-date. Please Note:It will only switch to this screen if updates are available. You will be redirected to the WH4B setup screen if no updates are available. I learned this the hard way because it stopped working after I had captured all the traces and information. Somehow, this new Windows Update Oobe screen stopped showing on 06-06-2024.Microsoft decided to withdraw a specific update on 07-06-2024, Kb5037850.With this update being revoked, no updates were detected, and with it, the new update screen didn\u2019t show up. It is also good to know that .net security updates will not trigger these new quality updates during the out-of-box experience. While the updates are downloaded and installed, you can monitor their status in the progress bar below. It will guide you through each step of the update process. Once finished, your device is up to date, secure, and ready to use!! The Quality Updates During out-of-box Experience Flow What would one of my first blog posts on the Patch My PC website be without my weird mspaint flow? In the flow below, I will explain how the latest Windows Security Updates are installed afterWindows Autopilot device Preparation. Quality updates during the out-of-box experience Explained Let\u2019s explain the flow from above a bit better so everyone can make sense of it (and not only me) By browsing the event logs, particularly in the Shell-core section, we can observe that theCloud Experience Hostis responsible for driving this UI change for quality updates. This same host manages several other features, including authentication and Windows Hello. We\u2019ll see theOut-of-box-experience New Device Update Page (OOBENDUP)kick in. The new Windows Update Experience process begins by checking if the feature is enabled on the device If the feature is enabled, it will check if the device is able to contacthttps://sdx.microsoft.com/frx/cloud-ndup. While it might seem unusual for the device to be offline, since Autopilot requires an internet connection, the check ensures the device is ready for updates in case of any unexpected connection issues. TheCloud Experience Hostgathers local data from the client and then reaches out to various endpoints to retrieve JSON files used for different purposes: sdx.microsoft.com/areas/frx/resources/json/NDUP_error_lottie.json sdx.microsoft.com/areas/frx/resources/json/cloudndup/expeditedUpdatelottie.json sdx.microsoft.com/areas/frx/resources/json/cloudndup/mercurylossAversionLottie.json sdx.microsoft.com/areas/frx/resources/json/cloudndup/windowsLogoLottie.json These JSON files influence the behavior of the Cloud Experience Host, but they don\u2019t provide much insight when accessed directly. This JSON file will be stored in the default user\u2019s local app data folder. Next, the device identifies the necessary updates (KBs) to download and install. At this stage in OOBE, a registry key is created:EnableExpeditedUpdateis set to 1. This triggers the Windows Update engine, Which starts downloading the required patches. As the download progresses, you will see the progress in the UI and with it the New Update Experience will start installing the the latest Quality updates during OOBE! Community Solutions to Prevent it! DuringWorkplace Ninjas 2024Mattias Melkerson shared a clever way to stop OOBE updates for those who don\u2019t want their Windows devices updated right after setup. His solution is straightforward: modify the host file to block thesdx.microsoft.comURL by routing it to null. Why this approach? It\u2019s simple. One of the first things the NDUP process does is check if the device can accesssdx.microsoft.com, which hosts the necessary JSON files for the update. If the cloudexperiencehost process can\u2019t access it (serveroffline:true) the JSON as shown above can\u2019t be downloaded, and with it, exiting the process. Go check out the Pro-active remediation he build! It\u2019s pretty awesome and very simple to implement OOBE will force you to quality update during onboarding \u2013 MSEndpointMgr Microsoft\u2019s announcement and response Almost six months ago, I wrote this blog about the new Windows Update experience during OOBE.At that time,MDM-enrolled deviceswouldALWAYSautomatically receive quality updates right after Autopilot enrollment, ensuring they were fully patched before users even reached the desktop. However, after rolling it out,Microsoft received significant feedback, and ultimatelydecided to pull it back. Now, it looks like they\u2019re working on a new approach, introducing an option todeferthese updates instead of forcing them immediately during OOBE. Upcoming Changes to Expedited Updates in OOBE A new feature will introduce an option todeferquality updates during OOBE. This will give organizations greater flexibility in managing updates during initial device setup. Rather than forcing an immediate update, it appears Microsoft is adding a mechanism to delay the process when necessary. This setting plays a major role in how updates are managed during OOBE. It allows IT administrators to postpone updates instead of applying them immediately. Since this is a big change in how Quality Update are deployed during OOBE, I\u2019ve written anew blog post.This one will dive deeper intohow deferral is handled, how policies interact with it. Read more about the new deferred update mechanism here Conclusion While I appreciate the new quality updates during the out-of-box experience, I have some questions regarding their implementation. It seems more like an OOBE addition than an Autopilot Device Preparation enhancement. Is it possible that Microsoft was unaware that this new screen also appears during Device Preparation? Let me tell you why. I have observed this OOBE update flow occurring on non-Autopilot enrolled 24H2 devices and even on Windows Home devices. I hope Microsoft ensures that this new OOBE update feature will continue to be displayed after Autopilot Device Preparation. Patch My PC enhances security by keeping all applications up to date. Microsoft should strive to achieve the same level of update management for Windows.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-11-administrator/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Say Hello to Windows 11 Administrator Protection: Secure Your Admins! This blog will dive into anew Windows 11 security featureannounced at Ignite 2024:Administrator Protection. Introduced in Windows 11, it replaces persistent admin rights with just-in-time privileges using a System Managed Admin Account. Goodbye, lingering tokens, hello, smarter security! The Admin Rights Balancing Act Admin rights are a necessary evil. Too much power? You\u2019re asking for privilege escalation attacks. Too little? You\u2019re dealing with frustrated users calling IT to install basic productivity apps. Local Administrator Protection puts an end to that juggling act. It gives users theflexibility of admin rightsonly when needed, without compromising security. Instead of permanent admin accounts with too many privileges that hang around long after they\u2019re needed, this new approach uses aSystem Managed Admin Account(AKA Super Admin account), that dynamically handles privileges only when they\u2019re needed. What Makes This Administrator Protection a Game-Changer? Traditionally, when a user is given admin rights on a Windows device, whether it\u2019s a local account or a Microsoft account, those privileges are always active, making the device an attractive target for attackers. If the account is compromised, attackers can immediately use those rights to install malware or gain even more control over the system. Enter UAC and the Clark Kent Mode. Legacy UAC That\u2019s where the good oldUser Account Control (UAC)tries to add some protection. When a user with admin privileges signs in, UAC creates a \u201csplit token\u201d for the session, this split token divides the user\u2019s identity into two separate parts: a standard user token and an admin token. By default, the user operates under the standard token, think of it as being in\u201cClark Kent\u201dmode. While the admin rights exist in the second token, they stay inactive until an action requiring admin rights is performed. To activate the admin privileges(switch to \u201cSuperman\u201d mode), the user must do something that needs higher permissions, like running a program as an administrator. This triggers a UAC prompt, asking the user to confirm if they want to use their full admin rights. Until the user says yes, those admin powers remain turned off, minimizing the risk if an attacker only gains access to the standard token. What\u2019s Different with Administrator Protection But even with UAC\u2019s split token system, attackers can still find ways to bypass it or manipulate the UAC prompt. This is whereAdministrator Protectionchanges the game. When enabled, instead of using the regular admin account for elevated actions, Administrator Protection creates a separate, hidden system managed admin account linked to the user but with one major twist: this hidden account only activates when elevated rights are needed. This means its privileges are inactive until a secure request is made. Once the task is complete, the privileges are locked away again, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to take advantage of these temporary admin rights. By isolating these admin actions into a separate profile,Administrator Protectionprovides an extra layer of security, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the regular admin account, they can\u2019t misuse the hidden admin privileges. How Do You Enable It? Setting It Up with Group Policy: OpenGroup Policy Management Console. OpenGroup Policy Management Console. Go to Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options.

User Account Control Behavior Of The Elevation Prompt: \u201cPrompt for consent on the secure desktop\u201d. Activating Administrator Protection via Account Protection Settings WIth the latest Windows Insider Preview 27774 being rolled out, we now have the option also to use the account protection settings if we want to enable the Local Administrator protection As shown above, we can simply click on the administrator protection feature in the Windows Security Settings. After clicking on the feature, we only need to flip the switch to activate the feature. Easy does it! What Does Administrator Protection Look Like in Action? When Administrator Protection is turned on (GPO/Intune Or Administrator Protection), and you try to run something as a local administrator, you\u2019ll notice a change, instead of seeing the usual User Account Control (UAC) screen, you\u2019ll be greeted by the Windows Security prompt. With this visual change, it\u2019s easy to see at a glance when Administrator Protection is active and handling your elevation requests, making security much more transparent and easier to manage for admins and users alike! This new prompt signals that Windows is using the System Managed Admin Account to process elevation requests, providing an extra layer of security. It not only enhances the protection for admin tasks but also makes it clear when isolated admin rights are being used, setting it apart from standard UAC prompts. But how does this magic work? How Does Administrator Protection Really Work? When you enable*Administrator Protection, Windows automatically creates aSystem Managed Admin Accountfor any user accounts with local admin rights (except for your protected Windows LAPS account. This one is excluded from this feature). This system-managed administrator account remains hidden and inactive until it\u2019s specifically needed. Instead of simply elevating the privileges of the logged-in user, Windows now switches to this separate, isolated admin account to perform the requested action. This change ensures that no admin privileges are directly tied to the user\u2019s account, reducing the risk of misuse or exploitation. You can see a detailed breakdown of how this flow works in the illustration below, showing how Windows securely handles elevation requests through this system-managed account rather than the standard UAC process. *Requirement: Windows Canary Build 27718 After the elevated task is done, the session ends, and the privileges are immediately revoked. This approach is like turning on a spotlight for a second, just enough to illuminate the task at hand, before plunging everything back into darkness. Breaking Down the Benefits Reduces Risk of Privilege Escalation:With the new system-managed account, admin tokens are no longer lingering around for the entire session. Instead, they\u2019re granted just-in-time and only for the exact duration needed, making it much harder for attackers to exploit them.

Stronger Security Think of the typical user who has been given admin rights for maintenance tasks or local troubleshooting. With Administrator Protection enabled, they can still perform these tasks, but when they elevate a process, the process will be executed in the additional system-managed account. Even if malware tries to hijack the session, it won\u2019t be able to use those elevated privileges, because theSystem Managed Admin Accountonly activates in a controlled manner. This not only helps instopping lateral movementbut also significantly cuts down the chance ofprivilege escalationattacks. Administrator Protection on Windows 11: Watch out for Bugs Local Administrator Protection is a fantastic step forward in securing admin rights, but it\u2019s not without its challenges. Let\u2019s start with the first issue: EPM: If you\u2019re running Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) alongside it, be prepared for some potential bugs. Combining these two features can create issues you might not see coming from unexpected errors, to blocked privilege elevations. And trust me, there\u2019s more to uncover. Curious about what might go wrong and how to handle it? I\u2019ve broken it all down inthis blog post. Don\u2019t let these surprises catch you off guard! This was the first issue; let\u2019s move on to the next one. EN-US: Failed to find MUI file. Besides,EPMno longer worked on the device when you activatedLocal Administrator protection. Please be aware that if you are NOT using an EN-US Windows Build, you are up for a challenge. This challenge can be more than you hoped for because it will prevent the local administrator from logging in. If you want to know more about how to fix it, please read this additional blog. Local Administrator Protection: Failed to find MUI File The Bottom Line: A Safer, Smarter Way to Handle Admin Rights The introduction of Local Administrator Protection is part of a larger trend of moving away fromstaticandalways-on permissionsto moredynamic,session-basedmanagement of privileges. It\u2019s a major shift that aligns with modern security practices likeZero Trust, where you never trust a device or user blindly.

Microsoft hasn\u2019t made a huge deal about it, but OSConfig quietly arrived in Windows Server 2025 with some powerful configuration management features. And here\u2019s a bonus: it even works on Windows 11, thanks to dmosconfig.dll (even if Microsoft hasn\u2019t officially called it out\u2026 we see it!). In this post, we\u2019ll dive into getting OSConfig up and running on your server, explore its role in enforcing security baselines, and uncover the brains behind it, such as dmosconfig.dll and the dcscvc service. You\u2019ll also see how OSConfig keeps configurations in line with its refresh task and built-in drift control (no GPOs!!!), letting you rest easy knowing your settings won\u2019t wander. Plus, I\u2019ll guide you through where OSConfig keeps its data in the registry, how to adjust its schedule with PowerShell, and how it follows a similar declared configuration model as Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). Why Use OSConfig? OSConfig is more than just another configuration tool\u2014it\u2019s a powerhouse for enforcing and maintaining compliance across different scenarios. Microsoft has provided a few ready-made configurations, or \u201cscenarios,\u201d to address specific security needs, including some security features such as:Security Baseline,SecureCore,Defender, andApp Control for Business (Windows Defender Application Control). Each of these scenarios is tailored for different aspects of security, allowing you to choose and apply configurations that meet your environment\u2019s requirements without piecing together settings manually. Key Benefits of OSConfig: Declarative Configuration: Instead of fiddling with every little setting in GPOs or scripting each step, OSConfig uses configuration documents that define theend state. You simply tell OSConfig what you want, whether it\u2019s enforcing a Security Baseline, enabling Defender policies, or locking down devices with Windows Defender application control, and it handles the \u201chow.\u201d This declarative model cuts down on errors and makes setup a breeze.

Compliance:OSConfig doesn\u2019t just apply a baseline and walk away. With its built-in drift control, OSConfig periodically checks configurations to ensure they remain aligned with your specified scenario (e.g., Security Baseline Configuration or SecureCore). This means that every few hours, OSConfig scans for any drift from the baseline configuration and corrects it automatically if changes are detected\u2014no need to wait for a GPO-style refresh or manually intervene.

In short, OSConfig handles compliance checks and locks in security settings, so you don\u2019t have to keep an eye on every detail yourself. Installing the OSConfig PowerShell Module To start using OSConfig, make sure the OSConfig PowerShell module is installed. Microsoft provides the module through the PowerShell Gallery, and you can find guidance in theofficial documentation. To start, install the module in PowerShell: Once installed, you\u2019ll find the module in this folder: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Microsoft.OSConfig\\1.1.0 This folder includes the essentials for OSConfig\u2019s functionality: After installing the module, the device will get a nice new enrollment! (where did I see this before) Number 28 seems to relate to the Windows Admin Center Enrollment Type. With the Module installed, let\u2019s play around with it and find out what commands are provided. With these commands, we can configure certain OSConfig scenarios, check compliance, and adjust drift control. Setting Up a Security Baseline Now that the module is ready let\u2019s get OSConfig up and running. We can do so by using the Set-OsconfigDesiredConfiguration and specifying one of the scenarios. AppControl(Windows Defender application control), Defender/Antivirus,SecuredCore or SecurityBaseline Please Note: Some OsConfig scenarios also work on Windows 11 if dmosconfig.dll is present. This example below focuses on a server in a workgroup environment, aka workgroup member. Deploying the Baseline: Start by enabling OSConfig and configuring it to apply a security baseline. The commands below enforce a baseline and perform compliance checks at regular intervals. Deploying the Baseline: Start by enabling OSConfig and configuring it to apply a security baseline. The commands below enforce a baseline and perform compliance checks at regular intervals. Set-OSConfigDesiredConfiguration -Scenario SecurityBaseline/WS2025/WorkgroupMember -Default \u201cSecurityBaseline/WS2025/WorkgroupMember\u201d refers to the specific baseline you want to enforce. This baseline document serves as the foundation for OSConfig to check against. Trigger a Compliance Check\u2013 Once the baseline is set, you can initiate a compliance check manually if needed by using the get-OSConfigDesiredConfiguration command. Trigger a Compliance Check\u2013 Once the baseline is set, you can initiate a compliance check manually if needed by using the get-OSConfigDesiredConfiguration command. This compliance check verifies that the current system state matches the baseline and reports any discrepancies. Adjust the Compliance Refresh Interval\u2013 You can also modify the frequency at which OSConfig checks for compliance (drift control) by setting a custom refresh interval. Adjust the Compliance Refresh Interval\u2013 You can also modify the frequency at which OSConfig checks for compliance (drift control) by setting a custom refresh interval. Set-OSConfigDriftControl -IntervalMinutes 45 # Sets the refresh interval to 45 minutes. These commands allow you to automate the management of configuration baselines and ensure they\u2019re enforced continuously. Now that we know what OSConfig is and how to set up a security baseline, let\u2019s dive deeper into how it keeps everything in compliance. DMOsConfig.dll: The Brain Behind OSConfig Meet dmosconfig.dll, the real powerhouse behind OSConfig. This DLL does the heavy lifting, reading configuration documents and enforcing settings to match your policies. Think of it as the ultimate enforcer, ensuring OSConfig\u2019s configurations stick. Then there\u2019s the declared configuration service, dcscvc, which keeps everything in line by continuously monitoring and enforcing those configurations. This service is the \u201cone\u201d handling all the Declared Documents and ensuring the policies are applied to the device. Let\u2019s examine how this task applies those declared documents. The Declared Configuration Service (dcscvc) At the heart of OSConfig\u2019s drift control lies the dcscvc service. This service processes configurations/policies through three essential stages: raw, cooked, and applied. Each stage plays a distinct role in transforming a configuration document from a simple set of instructions into active policies that shape your server\u2019s state. (GET-TEST-SET) Raw: When a configuration or policy document is first loaded, it enters the system in its raw state. At this stage, the configuration exists exactly as defined in the declared document, without any processing. Think of it as the unfiltered instructions that OSConfig will later refine. Raw: When a configuration or policy document is first loaded, it enters the system in its raw state. At this stage, the configuration exists exactly as defined in the declared document, without any processing. Think of it as the unfiltered instructions that OSConfig will later refine. Cooked: Next, dcscvc takes this raw data and processes it into a \u201ccooked\u201d state, converting the configurations into a system-compatible format. This stage ensures that each setting is validated and prepared for enforcement, reducing the risk of errors when it\u2019s applied. Cooked: Next, dcscvc takes this raw data and processes it into a \u201ccooked\u201d state, converting the configurations into a system-compatible format. This stage ensures that each setting is validated and prepared for enforcement, reducing the risk of errors when it\u2019s applied. Applied: Finally, dcscvc moves the cooked configurations to the applied state, turning them into active policies that govern the server\u2019s behavior. Once applied, these configurations become the \u201clive\u201d settings on the server. OSConfig\u2019s job isn\u2019t done here, though\u2014it continuously monitors these applied settings to ensure they align with the declared baseline. Applied: Finally, dcscvc moves the cooked configurations to the applied state, turning them into active policies that govern the server\u2019s behavior. Once applied, these configurations become the \u201clive\u201d settings on the server. OSConfig\u2019s job isn\u2019t done here, though\u2014it continuously monitors these applied settings to ensure they align with the declared baseline. This structured flow (raw \u2192 cooked \u2192 applied) is key to OSConfig\u2019s reliability. By processing each stage separately, OSConfig ensures that only validated, compatible settings make it to the active state, reducing the risk of misconfigurations. Drift Control: The Refresh Task and the Raw \u2192 Cooked \u2192 Applied Flow Now, here\u2019s where OSConfig\u2019s drift control magic truly kicks in\u2014therefresh task. Sounds a bit like Config Refresh, right? Well, actually, it is indeed. Config Refresh is for the old-school legacy Intune Policies. The Declared Configuration Refresh Schedule (Config Refresh on Steroids ) is for the new kind of settings called declared documents. Before zooming into the refresh schedule, let\u2019s discuss the state/stages of the declared documents first. This refresh schedule runs regularly (cadence), checking the active policies (in the applied state) against the baseline document to detect any drift. If a setting, let\u2019s sayEnableSmartScreen, has been changed outside of OSConfig\u2019s control, the refresh task will spot this inconsistency, triggering windows declared configuration service (WinDC) to reapply the baseline settings and bring the configuration back to compliance(even offline!! But then again..when would a server be offline.. its not a notebook) Let\u2019s look at what this flow looks like The Refresh Task Flow Let\u2019s start examining the Refresh Schedule by looking at this flowchart first. Here\u2019s a breakdown of this flow: Start Refresh Task\u2013 The refresh task is triggered on schedule, kicking off a scan to verify configurations against the baseline. Start Refresh Task\u2013 The refresh task is triggered on schedule, kicking off a scan to verify configurations against the baseline. Check Raw Configuration\u2013 The first step is to check the \u201craw\u201d configuration, stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftDeclaredConfiguration\\Raw. This raw data reflects the original, unprocessed settings as defined in your configuration document. Check Raw Configuration\u2013 The first step is to check the \u201craw\u201d configuration, stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftDeclaredConfiguration\\Raw. This raw data reflects the original, unprocessed settings as defined in your configuration document. Verify Cooked Configuration\u2013 OSConfig then processes the raw data into a format that the system can interpret and enforce, known as the \u201ccooked\u201d configuration. This cooked configuration is stored under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftDeclaredConfiguration\\Cooked. Verify Cooked Configuration\u2013 OSConfig then processes the raw data into a format that the system can interpret and enforce, known as the \u201ccooked\u201d configuration. This cooked configuration is stored under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftDeclaredConfiguration\\Cooked. Check for Discrepancies\u2013 The cooked configuration is then checked against the active system settings. If OSConfig detects any drift (for example, if EnableSmartScreen was disabled outside OSConfig\u2019s control), it will mark this discrepancy for correction. Check for Discrepancies\u2013 The cooked configuration is then checked against the active system settings. If OSConfig detects any drift (for example, if EnableSmartScreen was disabled outside OSConfig\u2019s control), it will mark this discrepancy for correction. Set Cooked Configuration\u2013 OSConfig resets the cooked configuration to align with the baseline, ensuring that any changes are reverted to the intended settings. Set Cooked Configuration\u2013 OSConfig resets the cooked configuration to align with the baseline, ensuring that any changes are reverted to the intended settings. Apply Cooked to Active Policies\u2013 The corrected, cooked configuration is applied to the system\u2019s active policies, stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System. This ensures that all settings on the device are now compliant with the declared document. Apply Cooked to Active Policies\u2013 The corrected, cooked configuration is applied to the system\u2019s active policies, stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System. This ensures that all settings on the device are now compliant with the declared document. Finalization and Logging\u2013 OSConfig logs the changes and finalizes the refresh task, recording any corrections it made during the process. This logging provides a record of enforcement actions, helping administrators audit changes. Finalization and Logging\u2013 OSConfig logs the changes and finalizes the refresh task, recording any corrections it made during the process. This logging provides a record of enforcement actions, helping administrators audit changes. Completion\u2013 With all settings verified and adjusted as needed, the refresh task completes. The system configuration is now back in compliance with the declared baseline. Completion\u2013 With all settings verified and adjusted as needed, the refresh task completes. The system configuration is now back in compliance with the declared baseline. This raw \u2192 cooked \u2192 applied flow ensures that OSConfig only applies validated settings, minimizing the chance of configuration issues while keeping your policies in line. Through this structured approach, OSConfig offers robust drift control, automatically detecting and correcting any unauthorized changes. Where OSConfig Lives: The Configuration Flow from JSON to Registry OSConfig uses a combination of file storage and registry entries to manage, apply, and monitor configurations. Here\u2019s how the process unfolds: Metadata Storage: The baseline metadata for each policy, including descriptions, compliance details, and severity levels, is stored in the registry under: This metadata provides OSConfig with essential information about each setting, such as default values, schema, and compliance requirements (e.g., AllowLocalSystemNULLSessionFallback). This is the foundational layer that OSConfig references to understand each policy\u2019s intended behavior. JSON Document Creation in ProgramData: When a new configuration or baseline is applied, the JSON file with all the settings will be first created in the C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\DC\\HostOS folder This JSON document (such as E17005D5-A50E-4E57-BE94-1DAF469C6F93_device_SecurityBaselineWS2025WorkgroupMember@2411.0) contains all the details of the security baseline, including specific settings, values, and metadata for each policy. This file serves as the blueprint OSConfig uses for enforcement. Registry Initialization: OSConfig then references this JSON file to initialize or update entries in the registry under: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\DeclaredConfiguration\\HostOS\\Config This step involves creating registry keys for each setting specified in the baseline, essentially \u201cloading\u201d the configurations from the JSON file into the system\u2019s registry. Policy Enforcement and Drift Control: Once the configuration data is established in the registry, OSConfig\u2019s dcscvc service uses it to enforce the baseline settings and continuously monitor for compliance. The refresh task periodically checks for drift and, if necessary, references both the JSON file and registry entries to revert settings back to the baseline. This flow, from JSON file creation to registry initialization and continuous monitoring, ensures that OSConfig maintains a reliable and persistent configuration state. By storing data in both ProgramData and the registry, OSConfig is equipped to handle configuration enforcement and drift control with minimal disruption to the system. OSConfig and EPM: Two Sides of Declared Configuration If you\u2019ve worked with Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM), OSConfig might feel a bit like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Both OSConfig and EPM rely on declared configuration models, meaning they don\u2019t just apply settings once and forget about them. They make sure those settings stick. EPM is all about managing privilege elevation rules and controlling who can run what with elevated permissions. OSConfig, on the other hand, takes this concept and applies it to server configurations and security baselines, keeping everything locked down just the way you want. Both tools have built-in drift control, so if anything strays from the defined policies, they\u2019ll pull it right back in line. Both store policies are declared documents, giving them a blueprint to follow and making it easy to spot any discrepancies. Essentially, OSConfig brings the same self-healing compliance model to server configurations that EPM brings to privilege management, automatically correcting issues as they pop up. It\u2019s like having a system watchdog in place that knows exactly how things should look and acts fast if anything is out of place. Wrapping Up: OSConfig Today\u2026 and a Hint at What\u2019s Next? OSConfig isn\u2019t just another configuration management tool, it\u2019s a powerful, structured approach that ensures your server configurations stay locked in and compliant. With dcscvc handling the raw \u2192 cooked \u2192 applied flow and the refresh task keeping a constant eye out for drift, OSConfig provides reliable, automated control over your server\u2019s settings and lets you deploy a security baseline within seconds. But here\u2019s the exciting part: if declared configuration policies can keep servers in line without the need for GPO-style refresh cycles, why stop there? Imagine a future where Intune pushes configuration baselines to workstations just like OSConfig does for servers. No more waiting for GPO refreshes\u2014just a seamless, automated refresh task that keeps every device securely aligned with policy. Declared configuration policies for Windows 2025 servers might just be the start. If OSConfig is anything to go by, we could be on the brink of a new era in device management, one where your entire fleet, from servers to workstations, stays securely in line with minimal intervention.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/psappdeploytoolkit-v4-upgrade/", "title": "", "raw_text": "PSAppDeployToolkit v4 \u2013 What\u2019s New and Why You Should Upgrade Introduction: A Legacy that Paved the Way PSAppDeployToolkit (PSADT) has long been the go-to solution for application deployment wrapping and underpins and integrates with many application repackaging and deployment solutions including our very own Scappman (part of the Patch My PC family), as well as Master Packager, Flexera, Juriba, Advanced Installer, Robopack, Raynet, Apptimized, XOAP, Sparkle Flow, as well as many others. It has become a critical component to providing standardized and consistently deployed applications for countless organizations, from small companies to global multinationals, federal agencies, universities, schools, hospitals, etc. However, Version 3.x has been around a long time, and as operating systems and PowerShell itself have evolved, it\u2019s been showing its age. While v3 is great, it was built around the Windows XP / Windows 7 and PowerShell 3.0 timeframe and has tried to maintain functional support for those right up until today. That\u2019s a long time \u2013 even longer than Microsoft offered paid Extended Support for Windows 7 (which ended in October 2023). And that means that PSADT hasn\u2019t been able to take advantage of newer capabilities in today\u2019s systems. But today, we are finally (FINALLY!) going to change that. MeetPSAppDeployToolkit v4. PSAppDeployToolkit v4 brings a modernized approach, rebuilt from the ground up to meet today\u2019s IT demands. It retains everything that made V3 great while introducing new features and enhancements designed for stability, performance, and flexibility. Whether you\u2019re familiar with PSADT or new to the toolkit, v4 is the next step forward \u2014 and it\u2019s here to make your deployments better than ever. View the PSAppDeployToolkit v4 official docs page to get started today: https://psappdeploytoolkit.com/docs/getting-started/download What\u2019s New in PSAppDeployToolkit v4? PSAppDeployToolkit v4 isn\u2019t just an update \u2014 it\u2019s a reimagining of the toolkit for the future. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the major improvements and why they matter to you. 1. Now a Code-Signed PowerShell Module The toolkit has evolved from being a massive dot-sourced script, into afully-fledged PowerShell module. Technically speaking, it\u2019s still a massive script \u2013 but the switch to being a module has allowed us to implement a lot of additional security features, which we\u2019ll talk about. Security is a top priority. With PSADT V4,the entire module is code-signedwith a valid certificate. This guarantees the integrity of the code and helps administrators comply with security policies in enterprise environments. There\u2019s a lot of other benefits from being a module too: Encapsulation of logic:Functionality is neatly contained, improving maintainability and readability.

So how do you create a new deployment to include the module? Simple. Just scaffold out a new deployment using the following command: 2. Full Backwards Compatibility with PSADT v3 script format We know you\u2019ve invested time and effort in creating your existing deployment scripts and no one wants to have to rewrite a script with new syntax, and retest everything in your environment. Thankfully, once a script is written and tested, you rarely need to touch it again. This allows you to migrate to the v4 format in your own time and only build against v4 for new deployments. This might take some time however, and so we\u2019ve created a compatibility layer! v4 will read your existing v3 scripts and remap the v3 commands to the new v4 format on-the-fly \u2013 with nothing new for you to learn. So, you can immediately start to take advantage of v4\u2019s speed and rock-solid stability. 3. New Lightweight Modern Fluent Interface We\u2019ve retained the existing look and feel for when you migrate an existing deployments over to V4 \u2013 it\u2019s seamless so there\u2019s no code to rewrite, and things stay the same for you end users (note: if you\u2019ve modified the on-screen messaging, you\u2019ll need to copy your changes into the new config and language files). Your customers won\u2019t notice any visible difference when a deployment runs. With v4, however, you now have the option of using the newfluent interface,which has a simplified workflow with a beautiful and modern look and feel that supports light and dark mode. We\u2019ve scaled back the size of the UI and reduced its wordiness. We\u2019ve also moved its on-screen location to mimic Windows Toast Notifications. As before, it is of course customizable with your own logo and banners. We wanted this to be simple and intuitive, but beautiful \u2013 and we hope you\u2019ll agree it hits the mark. 4. PowerShell 7 and ARM support. PSADT v4 fully supportsPowerShell 7and theARMplatform, bringing access to both modern PowerShell features as well as modern hardware. This ensures you\u2019re not locked into older versions and can leverage the latest PowerShell improvements. 5.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-11-24h2-applocker-powershell-constrained-language-broken/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows 11 24H2: AppLocker Script Enforcement broken If you are moving devices toWindows 11 24H2, there is acritical security problemyou should know about. On Windows 11 24H2, Constrained Language Mode is no longer enforced correctly when using AppLocker Script Rules. PowerShell scripts that should be heavily restricted now run fully unrestricted in Full Language Mode. This opens up a major security enforcement gap that administrators need to understand and mitigate before upgrading to Windows 24h2. Applocker: Why Application Control Matters Application control is a critical part of securing Windows environments. Blocking unauthorized code from running is one of the most effective ways to reduce attack surface, prevent lateral movement, and stop exploits that rely on executing new or modified binaries. AppLocker allows organizations to define exactly which executables, installers, and scripts are permitted. In addition to managing traditional applications, AppLocker can also apply control over scripts such as PowerShell scripts and batch files. By enforcing AppLocker script rules, administrators can ensure that only trusted, intended automation runs across devices, reducing the risk of abuse through scripting engines like PowerShell. This is achieved by enforcing Constrained Language Mode inside PowerShell. Let\u2019s zoom in on that first! Full Language Mode vs Constrained Language Mode in PowerShell When PowerShell scripts are allowed to run without restriction, PowerShell operates in Full Language Mode. In this mode, scripts have access to the full capabilities of the platform, including .NET libraries, direct API calls, and dynamic code execution. Constrained Language Mode provides a much more limited environment. Scripts running under CLM are restricted to basic cmdlets and approved types. They cannot create new .NET objects, access external libraries, or perform advanced operations that could compromise a device. This mode is critical for ensuring that even if a script runs, privileges cannot be escalated easily. Feature Full Language Mode Constrained Language Mode Access to .NET APIs Full access Blocked Create custom types Allowed Blocked P/Invoke and native calls Allowed Blocked Reflection and dynamic code Allowed Blocked Use basic cmdlets Allowed Allowed For a deeper technical explanation of how Constrained Language Mode works, refer to thePatch My PC blog here. How PowerShell Determines Language Mode Based on AppLocker Script Rules When PowerShell starts, it checks whetherAppLocker Script EnforcementRules are present. It does this by simulating the execution of a test PowerShell script placed in the user\u2019s temporary folder and evaluating it against the system\u2019s policies. As shown below, the DLL (System.Management.Automation.dll) responsible for PowerShell shows this behavior. This means that if AppLocker\u2019s rules block or restrict the test PS1 file, PowerShell automatically switches into Constrained Language Mode. If no restrictions apply, PowerShell Scripts will be executed in full language mode. This automatic detection has worked reliably for years and has been a simple way to enforce script safety without needing extra configuration inside PowerShell itself. Constrained Language Mode Windows 11 24H2 and Applocker With Windows 11 24H2, this behavior has quietly changed. Even with AppLocker Script Rules correctly configured and enforced, PowerShell scripts are no longer executed in contained language mode but in Full language mode, which creates a significant security concern. To find out what changed, we performed some tests. We first executed this PowerShell command from a user session with Applocker script enforcement active. As shown below, it first indeed showed us that constrainedlanguage was active and it blocked the WriteLine command, mentioning that the method invocation is not supported. But!!! As shown above, executing a PowerShell script with the same PowerShell command from that same user session showed us that it was running FullLanguage. With the PowerShell script running in full language mode, it indeed also showed the Hello output! That\u2019s not good data at all and not expected behavior! During the second test, the same default AppLocker policies behaved correctly on Windows 11 23H2, making it clear that the change was specific to the new Windows 11 24h2 version. As shown above, AppLocker\u2019s contained language mode enforcement still worked; executing scripts were executed in constrained language mode. At first, I had the idea that Microsoft changed something in the Applocker code, but given that Microsoft is not putting any effort into updating Applocker anymore (it is deprecated), it was clear that we needed to start looking at how PowerShell was dealing with Applocker. System.Management.Automation.dll in Windows 11 24h2 To find the root cause, we decided to do something stupid. We started the test by replacing the newer System.Management.Automation.dll from Windows 11 24H2 with the older version from a Windows 11 23H2 build. We did so by using the Recovery Environment, as the file was always in use by Windows itself. After we replaced the system.management.automation.dll with an older version, we re-ran the same test. This time, after running the PowerShell script, PowerShell immediately returned to its expected behavior:enforcing Constrained Language Mode when AppLocker Script Rules were active. This confirmed that the replaced DLL was responsible for breaking the enforcement of constrained language mode. Windows 11 24H2: A Closer Look at WLDPCanExecuteFile After discovering that the DLL update caused the behavioral change, a deeper investigation into the system\u2019s evaluation flow revealed a second important change. Windows 11 24H2 introduced a new API inside the Security.SystemPolicy PowerShell Function. If we zoom into SystemPolicy a bit more, we will notice that before checking lockdown policies, the system now first calls a new method namedWldpCanExecuteFile. This change modifies how PowerShell determines whether a script is allowed to run under restrictions. How WldpCanExecuteFile Changes Script Evaluation in Applocker If WldpCanExecuteFile allows the script to execute, PowerShell immediately runs in Full Language Mode without consulting the lockdown policy. Only if execution is blocked by CanExecuteFile does the system fall back to evaluating the lockdown policy. This small change in flow has major consequences. By trusting the result ofCanExecuteFiledirectly, PowerShell bypasses the expected fallback to AppLocker Script Rules for enforcing Constrained Language Mode. Why AppLocker Script Enforcement Breaks Somehow, it feels like with the additional WLDP functionality being added, Microsoft unintentionally broke how AppLocker enforces Constrained Language Mode. Instead of properly falling back to AppLocker evaluation when WDAC allows a script, PowerShell assumes that no further restriction is needed. This leads to scripts being executed fully unrestricted, even when AppLocker Script Rules are active. One thing is certain: the detection of whether the system lockdown policy (through AppLocker) is active no longer works correctly when running PowerShell scripts on Windows 11 24H2. A Note About PowerShell 5.1 and WLDP As shown below, Microsoft mentions that Windows PowerShell 5.1 does not officially support theWldpCanExecuteFileAPI. However, when running on Windows 11 24H2, PowerShell 5.1 seems to use this API if it is available in the underlying operating system. This happens because PowerShell\u2019s internalSystemPolicylogic checks at runtime whetherthe WldpCanExecuteFileAPI exists. If it does, PowerShell 5.1 calls it and trusts the result to determine how scripts should be executed. In other words, even though PowerShell 5.1 was not recompiled to \u201csupport\u201d this new API, its flexible detection logic allows it to use the updated WLDP enforcement behavior when exposed by the platform. This is why script enforcement behavior has changed on Windows 11 24H2, even though the same PowerShell 5.1 version number is used. Please note:This conclusion is partly based on observed behavior and reverse engineering. However, it fits the change introduced in Windows 11 24H2 and how PowerShell now determines language mode during script execution. A Quick Note About PowerShell 7 While analyzing the issue, we also noticed that a related fix was submitted to the PowerShell GitHub repository. The Pull Request addresses the same detection problem by ensuring that PowerShell 7.x correctly falls back to lockdown policy checks when needed. This confirms that the issue with WldpCanExecuteFile and script enforcement is known, and is being corrected for PowerShell 7. However, since Windows PowerShell 5.1 is built into Windows 11 24H2 and remains in maintenance mode, it will continue to be affected. : Related GitHub Pull Request:PowerShell PR #25305 Why Manual DLL Replacement Is Not a Real Solution Even though replacing the DLL temporarily restores expected behavior, Windows File Protection mechanisms and servicing updates will eventually overwrite unauthorized changes. Tampering with protected system components risks system instability and breaks the official Windows update path. A real solution must work within the supported platform model. Moving to Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) The sustainable way forward is to move from relying on AppLocker alone to usingWindows Defender Application Control (WDAC). WDAC operates deeper in the Windows security model and can enforce Constrained Language Mode through trusted code integrity policies. WDAC guarantees that scripts run in restricted environments, even if underlying system behaviors like CanExecuteFile checks are introduced. Although implementing WDAC requires careful planning and testing, it provides stronger guarantees than AppLocker alone, especially on evolving platforms like Windows 11 24H2. How Microsoft Fixed the Broken Enforcement With the 2025-05 May Security Update, Microsoft seems to have fixed this Constrained Language Mode issue. They fixed it by not really changing PowerShell itself, but by correcting the logic inside theWindows Lockdown Policy (WLDP)runtime. When a script is meant to be restricted, WldpCanExecuteFile now correctly returns RequireSandbox. PowerShell then maps that result to Constrained Language Mode using an internal enum (SystemScriptFileEnforcement). This behavior is only active when a specific feature flag is enabled: Feature_832843065. When that flag is on, PowerShell stops relying on global lockdown policies and temporary test files, and instead switches to evaluating script files individually. The result from WldpCanExecuteFile is passed through a method calledConvertToModernFileEnforcement, which translates it into the correct enforcement behavior: Allowed\u2192 Full Language Mode RequireSandbox\u2192 Constrained Language Mode Blocked\u2192 Execution denied So, while PowerShell already had the plumbing in place, the real fix came from WLDP returning the correct information and the feature flag enabling this modernized logic path. Once that was aligned, enforcement started working again, just as administrators expected. Conclusion: Windows 11 24H2 introduces a serious but subtle change that affects environments relying on AppLocker Script Rules to control PowerShell. Organizations relying on AppLocker should treat script lockdown enforcement as unreliable on Windows 11 24H2 and plan mitigation strategies accordingly.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/cybersecurity-vulnerability-types/", "title": "", "raw_text": "What is Vulnerability in Cyber Security? Types and Meaning Attackers are always looking for the opportunity to breach a system, so a tight security posture is required\u2014and this means being on top of any potential cyber security vulnerability. Patch management is an essential part of the process that helps IT staff protect business resources. Vulnerabilities in cyber security may appear even on the largest enterprise product, as on theWindows Print Spooler in 2021. That weakness left users of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 and 2016 systems vulnerable to attacks, including data breaches. Even after Microsoft released a patch, many computers are still unpatched and risk an exploit. Every modern software product and system today can face a security vulnerability. Hence, organizations that want to protect their critical processes and operations need to understand cyber security vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. What Is a Vulnerability in Cyber Security? Let\u2019s start with a definition:A vulnerability is a weakness in an IT system that an attacker can exploit to deliver an attack. Security vulnerabilities can result from a system flaw, an error in software features, or more. When an attacker finds a vulnerability, they will use it to bypass security controls and gain illegitimate access to a system or network. Types of Vulnerabilities There are six main categories of security vulnerabilities, classified according to where they are found. The Hardware Computer hardware and physical infrastructure can be exposed to sabotage, firmware vulnerabilities, or theft. The Software Software may have design flaws, input validation errors, insufficient testing, side-channel attacks, user interface failures, format string attacks, HTTP header injection, and more. The Network Networks are complex infrastructures, and a typical control system uses multiple computing and communications tools. Each of them, as well as their software, can be a victim of an attack. Network vulnerabilities can include insecure network architecture, poor network security practices, man-in-the-middle attacks, or poor authentication practices. Example ofBYOD Network Architecture The Personnel People are the first line of defense and the first cause of security vulnerabilities. Security weakness can come from a poor recruiting policy, insufficient security training, or inadequate security hygiene, such as a lack of password management, or employees accidentally downloading malware. Organizational Deficiencies Organizations may put themselves at risk with poor internal controls and a lack of an incident response plan or continuity plan. Physical site Cyber security vulnerability can also stem from a poor choice of place, such as an area with high foot traffic, an unreliable power source, or poor connectivity. Vulnerability vs. Risk vs. Threat The terms vulnerability, threat, and risk are not interchangeable\u2014they refer to different things you should protect your system from. Let\u2019s explain each definition in more detail. As we said before, avulnerabilityis a weakness in a system that malicious actors can exploit. For example, an excess of permissions in accounts or mistakes in code that cybercriminals can use to access the network. Athreatis what cybercriminals do to exploit a vulnerability. Ariskis the probability and impact of a vulnerability being exploited\u2014the damage the attack can cause, the potential loss, destruction, or theft of your assets. Risk is the measure of what can happen when the attacker exploits the vulnerability. Watch this video that explains the differences between bugs, cyber security vulnerabilities, exploits, and threats: What Causes Vulnerabilities? There are many causes of security vulnerabilities. Here is a summary: Complex systems:The more complex the infrastructure, the more moving parts it has, increasing the risk of flaws, misconfiguration, or unauthorized access. Familiarity of the attacker with the system:Sharing or reusing code, operating systems, and hardware increases the probability that an attacker knows about the system\u2019s vulnerabilities. Weak credentials:Weak passwords are easy to break. Reusing or sharing passwords can easily result in a data breach. Operating system flaws:Unpatched or outdated operating systems can allow malicious actors to gain access and inject malware. Software bugs:Any software can have exploitable bugs, either because of a programming error or a deliberate attack. Robust patch management prevents attackers from exploiting bugs. What Are the Most Common Security Vulnerabilities to Watch For? Every organization must control cyber security vulnerabilities. Hence, understanding what you need to watch for is critical to prevent giving cybercriminals an opening. Here are the seven most common cyber vulnerabilities. Zero-Day Vulnerability Frequently used in cyber attacks by sophisticated cybercriminals, these vulnerabilities can quickly pose a risk to any unpatched computer or system. A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw or error discovered by the attackers that are not yet patched by the software vendor. This type of exploit may cause extensive damage because the attack may be well on its way by the time it\u2019s detected. To detect and mitigate zero-day attacks, the key is prevention through a strong security posture and patch management. A solid response plan is also essential to respond quickly in the event of an exploit. Remote Code Execution Remote code execution is a type of vulnerability that enables a cybercriminal to execute malicious code remotely on a computer. An RCE vulnerability, when exploited, can range from executing malware to completely controlling the system. Misconfiguration of Firewalls Outdated firewall software is a common vulnerability\u2014it\u2019s easy to fall behind the scheduled updates and patches. Poor patching habits can result in an exposure. Misconfiguration and poorly applied security controls are other potential vulnerabilities. Legacy or Unpatched Software Vendors release patches and application updates periodically for a reason; either they want to add new features, or they want to patch discovered vulnerabilities. When you don\u2019t patch or update your software in time, your system is an easy target for cybercriminals. Unsecured APIs Because APIs often have a public IP address, they are easily exposed to attackers if not properly secured. An unsecured API is usually a result of human error or lack of security control. Good IT hygiene and specific controls are critical to prevent APIs from being used in breaches. Features A malicious actor can manipulate a function to breach a system. For instance, JavaScript is one of the most used functionalities by attackers. User Errors Users are a common source of vulnerabilities. Poor password management, falling for phishing or malicious emails, installing malware unknowingly, or revealing credentials are some of the vulnerabilities caused by users. OS Command Injections Shell injections happen when a malicious actor executes an OS command on the victim\u2019s server with the intention of reaching deeper into the organization. Typically, poor input data validation causes this vulnerability. To prevent this, you should implement strong validation protocols. SQL injection This web security vulnerability enables an attacker to view or modify a database by injecting malicious SQL code into an application. The attacker interferes with the communication between the application and the database, accessing the sensitive data. What Makes a Vulnerability Exploitable? Vulnerabilities need to be examined on a case-by-case basis\u2014not every vulnerability is worth an exploit for an attacker. For instance, if the attack surface is reduced, the attacker can\u2019t do much damage. Or the opposite may happen: the vulnerability gives the cybercriminal privileged access to business-critical applications. A vulnerability may also be linked to other vulnerabilities in your system, which can cause a snowball effect. Therefore, it\u2019s important to understand the exploitability of a specific vulnerability. What is Risk-Based Vulnerability Management? There are five critical steps in the vulnerability management lifecycle: Assess Start by knowing what assets you need to evaluate for vulnerabilities, and then assess each one, mapping which assets are at risk and may need patching. There are two ways of installing an agent on each asset or using a network-based solution: Agent-based assessments: These involve installing an individual sensor on each asset. This is the most popular method today. The problem is that organizations often need to scan only part of the environment at a time on large systems. Network-based scans:These require that all endpoints are on the network. The problem with network-based scans is that they cannot evaluate assets that are not connected to the network. After the scan, the solution usually produces a report. These legacy methods present the challenge of not being up to date\u2014the report presents a static picture, not a dynamic one. Modern vulnerability management tools provide a continuous assessment, thanks to cloud technologies. They allow security teams to see vulnerabilities in real time so they can be prioritized and addressed. Prioritize Once you know which assets and systems are potentially vulnerable, there are three steps to evaluate the situation: Identify the most valuable assets.Prioritize critical assets. Gauge the degree to which they are exposed to threats.Investigate the level of risk for each essential asset. Add context.Tapping into threat intelligence will provide the insights you need to correctly determine the risk you assessed in steps 1 and 2. Act Once the vulnerabilities and cyber security risks are identified, security teams can opt to accept the risk or mitigate or remediate the vulnerability. Accepting the risk is a relatively safe option if there is a vulnerability with low exploitability or for non-critical assets. Mitigation is a better option for medium risk essential assets. For critical assets or high-risk vulnerabilities, remediation\u2014patching or upgrading the asset\u2014is the only safe choice. Reassess After acting on the vulnerability, it\u2019s time to reevaluate. This helps you determine if your line of action was correct. It will also show if any new vulnerabilities have appeared linked to the ones you just remediated. Improve This final stage involves examining the entire vulnerability lifecycle and looking for ways to improve it. This is a time to strengthen weak defenses and work to eliminate potential issues. Why is Vulnerability Management Important to Prevent Attacks in CyberSecurity? Vulnerability management strengthens the organization\u2019s security posture overall, but also has specific benefits: Allows security teams torespond faster to threats. For example, theLog4j vulnerabilitywas identified before the holiday season started in 2021, which could have been a disaster if exploited. Leveraging vulnerability scans and assessmentsimproves visibility over your assets, their level of exposure, and risks. Saves money.Prevents exploits and data breaches, which can cause loss of business and result in financial losses. What Should You Do if You Find a Vulnerability in Your System? This is a common dilemma: if you find a vulnerability, should you disclose it immediately, or not? Thefull and immediate disclosureadvocates believe that open sharing about problems\u2014with the broader public and relevant authorities\u2014facilitates faster patching, improving the overall security posture. Many security regulations require full disclosure within a certain period of time. Detractors of the full disclosure say it makes attackers aware of the vulnerability. They supportlimited disclosure: limiting the news about the vulnerability to affected stakeholders and authorities. Why Should Businesses Focus on Vulnerability Prevention? Correct management of cybersecurity vulnerabilities strengthens the organization\u2019s overall security posture by detecting weaknesses and flaws that an attacker could exploit. One of the keys to robust vulnerability management ispatch management.Patch My PC automates patch management for third party applications in Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager, enhancing IT security and preventing vulnerabilities from appearing in your infrastructure.

But with the right tools, like PowerShell, and thisAdvanced IME and ESP Troubleshooting guide,you can quickly get to the root of the issue. This post will walk you through the IME\u2019s ESP detection flow step-by-step. We\u2019ll show you how each phase works and provide scripts to help you determine the ESP phase yourself. Introduction and a small recap Our last blog explored how devices can get stuck on the Enrollment Status Page (ESP),particularly when the Intune Management Extension (IME) can\u2019t progress beyond the Account Setup phase. The IME relies on specific registry keys and status checks to determine each phase of the ESP flow. By taking a look at theIntune Management Extension logs,you could see it for yourself, but here\u2019s a quick recap of how it works: Check FirstSync: IME first verifies if the device has completed initial syncing with Intune by checking the FirstSyncSID registry key. If the key is missing or IsSyncDone is not set to 1, IME halts at Account Setup, assuming the sync isn\u2019t complete.

If the key is missing or IsSyncDone is not set to 1, IME halts at Account Setup, assuming the sync isn\u2019t complete. Verify Sidecar Policy Provider Installation: After confirming sync, IME checks the InstallationState of the Sidecar Policy Provider. If not set to \u201cCompleted,\u201d it indicates that essential provisioning policies aren\u2019t fully deployed yet. Verify Sidecar Policy Provider Installation: After confirming sync, IME checks the InstallationState of the Sidecar Policy Provider. If not set to \u201cCompleted,\u201d it indicates that essential provisioning policies aren\u2019t fully deployed yet. Confirm Provisioning Completion: IME then verifies the HasProvisioningCompleted status to ensure that the device provisioning process is done. A true value here means the device is ready to continue beyond provisioning. Confirm Provisioning Completion: IME then verifies the HasProvisioningCompleted status to ensure that the device provisioning process is done. A true value here means the device is ready to continue beyond provisioning. Track Sidecar Policy Creation: Once provisioning completes, IME verifies that tracking policies are in place by checking the TrackingPoliciesCreated flag. If missing, it pauses until these policies are properly applied.

Any app that\u2019s not fully installed, or in progress, will delay IME from marking the ESP as complete. Diving into the GetESPPhase step by step Now, let\u2019s dive into each ESP phase, adding PowerShell scripts that let you check these settings directly and troubleshoot where the Microsoft Intune Management Extension (IME) might be encountering issues. Step 1: CheckESPPhase and the FirstSync Key After opening the Intune Management Extension log files with the CMTrace tool, we will notice that the FirstSyncSID key indicates whether a device\u2019s initial sync was completed successfully. If it\u2019s present, ESP should set the NotInEsp status. If that key below (SID) doesn\u2019t exist and with it, the IsSyncDone is not set to 1, the IME will stay in the Account Setup Phase. You can check it yourself by running this PowerShell Script: So, for example if the FirstSync key is created but the user-level Issyncdone is missing, this script will show you the outcome: Step 2: Verify InstallationState of the Sidecar PolicyProvider After trying to find the IsSyncDone for the logged in use, the IME now starts checking the SideCar InstallationState. . This code will check the InstallationState and if it is set to complete, not installed, or in progress The PowerShell Script Example: Step 3: Verify HasProvisioningCompleted After checking the Sidecar Intune Agent, the IME verifies whether the device provisioning is marked complete. This code above, checks if the hasprovisioningcompleted has been set. We can spot the same in the appworkload.log (Intune log) Use this to check its status: Step 4: Check Sidecar Tracking Policies Created Once provisioning completes, IME checks if tracking policies are set. Run this script to check Sidecar tracking policies: Step 5: Device and Account Setup IME continues with checking all tracked apps in the device and user/account phases to confirm they\u2019re complete. It does so by kicking off the CheckDeviceAndAccountSetupStateWithWmi IME function. We can do the same for the device-level checks, using this script: # Step 3: Check app tracking status for the device phase (via WMI) This script will check the installation state of the tracked applications Wrapping Up These PowerShell scripts offer a direct way to monitor and troubleshoot the ESP phases. By running these checks, you can pinpoint where IME might be getting stuck in the Account Setup phase, helping you resolve ESP issues without extensive guesswork Here\u2019s a thought: you can even combine these scripts to build your own requirement rule for Win32 apps. Doing so allows you to make them applicable only if the device is in provisioning mode. Or should we do that for you? Let us know!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-11-upgrade-planning-readiness/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows 11 Upgrade Planning: Readiness and Reporting Insights Upgrading to a new operating system can be challenging, and Windows 11 is no different. Many organizations planning to upgrade their systems to Windows 11 might think they\u2019re prepared, especially if they\u2019ve previously upgraded to Windows 10. However, Windows 11 brings its own set of challenges, from meeting new hardware requirements to managing resources effectively. In this blog post, we\u2019ll walk you through the essential steps and tools needed for a smooth transition to Windows 11. We will focus on two main tasks: Collecting information to identify compatibility issues. Understanding and using the collected data effectively. Whether you\u2019re using Configuration Manager or Intune, we\u2019ll explain the readiness dashboards, reporting options, and practical tips to ensure your devices are ready for the Windows 11 upgrade. We\u2019ll cover everything from gathering initial data, checking compatibility, and using detailed reports for better decision-making. Configuration Manager \u2013 Windows 11 Readiness Dashboard Organizations using Microsoft Configuration Manager to manage Windows 10 operating systems can already orchestrate the required components to allow managed Windows devices to upgrade to Windows 11. This is one of the areas in which the Configuration Manager is more than capable of handling, but it also lacks reporting. Not just reporting on \u201cDid my device successfully upgrade?\u201d but even the first question, \u201cWhich of my devices are Windows 11 ready?\u201d In Configuration Manager version 2309, the \u2018Windows 11 Upgrade Readiness Dashboard\u2019 was introduced to provide details on\u2018Upgrade Experience Indicators\u2019.The goal is to give visibility on which devices meet the Windows 11 minimum requirements. The report prerequisites are all fairly straightforward: For Configuration Manager version 2203 or later, the WebView2 console extension must be installed.If needed, select the notification bell in the top right corner of the console to install the extension. For Configuration Manager version 2203 or later, the WebView2 console extension must be installed. If needed, select the notification bell in the top right corner of the console to install the extension. If needed, select the notification bell in the top right corner of the console to install the extension. Windows 10 telemetry services should be enabled at basic level. Windows 10 telemetry services should be enabled at basic level. Hardware inventory to be enabled on all client devices. Hardware inventory to be enabled on all client devices. One area that can catch admins off guard is setting the correct telemetry data collection settings for clients. Using the Group Policy object, this can easily be achieved: Windows 10:Computer ConfigurationAdministrative TemplatesWindows ComponentsData Collection and Preview BuildsAllow Telemetry\u2013 Enabled and set to 1 \u2013 Basic. Windows 10:Computer ConfigurationAdministrative TemplatesWindows ComponentsData Collection and Preview BuildsAllow Telemetry\u2013 Enabled and set to 1 \u2013 Basic. Windows 11:Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds > Allow Diagnostic Data\u2013 Enabled and set to (1) Send required diagnostic data. Windows 11:Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds > Allow Diagnostic Data\u2013 Enabled and set to (1) Send required diagnostic data. Setting these GPOs creates the registry DWORD: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DataCollection, DWORD: AllowTelemetry, value=1 Data Source The data that drives the Windows 11 Readiness Dashboard reporting feature is generated locally by the built-in \u2018Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser\u2019 process. The Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, executed by the CompatTelRunner.exe scheduled task, collects system information to evaluate device compatibility with Windows OS versions. It involves the Appraiser.sdb (Shim Database) file, which contains compatibility information, and the Appraiser_TelemetryRunList.xml file, which provides processing rules. This process generates registry entries and .bin files, which Configuration Manager uses to determine upgrade readiness. There is very little official Microsoft documentation around that covers the process in any great depth. However, there is an excellent blog by Adam Gross that unpacks a lot of this process and explains the specifics around how the \u2018Appraiser.sdb\u2019 and \u2018Appraiser_TelemetryRunList.xml\u2019 are used, including how to make sense of the compatibility assessment results. Be sure to have a read of his blog here:Demystifying Windows 10 Feature Update Blocks-A Square Dozen | A. Gross Blog The Configuration Manager client hardware inventory process collects data from the registry entries produced by the CompatTelRunner.exe process. In addition to storing data in the mentioned .bins files, some of the data is written to \u2018HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersionAppCompatFlags\\TargetVersionUpgradeExperienceIndicators\u2019. This, in turn, populates a Configuration Manager inventory class \u2018SMS_UpgradeExperienceIndicators\u2019 with a bunch of properties and values. Version This property represents the value of the Windows 11 release against which the compatibility assessment has been processed. The values aren\u2019t very well documented, but essentially, the version values in Windows 11 builds indicate the development cycle, release schedule, and internal codenames used by Microsoft. Here, we are expected to see the following values: \u00b7 CO21H2 (likely \u2018Cobalt\u2019) \u00b7 NI22H2 / 23H2 (likely \u2018Nickel\u2019) \u00b7 GE24H2 (likely \u201cGermanium\u201d). \u00b7 UNV (Not confirmed, but this could mean \u2018Universal\u2019 and contains data that applies across any operating system feature update.) AppraiserVersion The version of the compatibility appraiser database used for the assessment. Reason This property will store values related to the blocking \u2018reason\u2019 for the upgrade compatibility assessment. (CPU, TPM, etc) TimeStamp Date / Time the data was captured. UpgExProp & UpgExU. Again, little information is available explaining the difference between these two properties. However, we know that for the compatibility assessment to pass, both of these properties should be reporting \u2018Green\u2019. There\u2019s a traffic-light approach in use; Red is a blocker, Orange is a more complex set of results with multiple triggers that define the property status, and Yellow status generally points towards an incompatible application that needs to be removed. Client Inventory Collection Configuration Manager clients collect and submit the data from the inventory class \u2018SMS_UpgradeExperienceIndicators\u2019 during the regular inventory schedule defined in the client settings policy. Reporting Experience The dashboard is embedded into the Configuration Manager console within the Software Library node. As well as showing metrics around OS version information and feature upgrade versions, four categories define the\u2018upgrade experience indicators\u2019: \u00b7 \u2018Ready For Upgrade\u2019 \u00b7 \u2018App Upgrade/Uninstall Required\u2019 \u00b7 \u2018App/Driver Upgrade Required\u2019 \u00b7 \u2018Cannot Upgrade\u2019 Within the Upgrade Experience Indicators section, you can click on the actual donut chart to view the devices within that category. For example, clicking the \u2018Cannot Upgrade\u2019 metric takes us to the assets and compliance view into a \u2018Cannot Upgrade\u2019 list of the associated devices. The \u2018Reason\u2019 column provides one or more string values to indicate the blocking information. From this device list view we can add devices to new or existing collections. Configuration Manager Summary The Configuration Manager Windows 11 Readiness dashboard provides fairly basic visibility into identifying the device\u2019s upgrade compatibility. Satisfying the prerequisites is quite straightforward, with the only trip up likely to be the setting of the telemetry logging on the clients. The blocking \u2018reason\u2019 string values could be better defined, and if there are unsupported applications or drivers blocking upgrades, you don\u2019t get to see the extra detail of what they are. Overall, if you\u2019re using Configuration Manager, it\u2019s a reasonable starting point to identify devices compatible with Windows 11 but be prepared to do some additional digging for the blocking reasons, particularly around applications and drivers. Intune Reporting \u2013 Windows 11 Readiness Like Configuration Manager, Intune can be used to upgrade managed Windows devices to Windows 11 OS. The toolsets for both have different features and capabilities to achieve the goal, and they both offer a certain level of reporting for Windows 11 readiness. Intune does offer a more comprehensive reporting library than Configuration Manager, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the overall reporting experience will meet our expectations, particularly when focusing on Windows 11 readiness. Amongst the available reports, there are three which can be used: Windows feature update device readiness reportThis report provides information about which devices have compatibility risks associated with upgrading to a particular Windows OS version. Windows feature update device readiness report This report provides information about which devices have compatibility risks associated with upgrading to a particular Windows OS version.

This report focuses on the minimum system requirements for Windows 11 and which devices are \u2018capable\u2019 or not, including details on the specific hardware blockers. Prerequisites Apart from the obvious, e.g. devices must be managed by Intune (or ConfigMgr co-managed), devices joined to Entra or Entra hybrid joined, telemetry data must be enabled and be captured using Intune data collection policy. To be eligible for the Windows Feature Update Device Readiness and Windows Feature Update Compatibility Risks reports, devices must: Run a supported version of Windows 10 or later with the latest cumulative update Run a supported version of Windows 10 or later with the latest cumulative update Be Microsoft Entra joined or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Be Microsoft Entra joined or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Be managed by Intune (including co-managed devices) or a supported version of the Configuration Manager client with tenant attach enabled Be managed by Intune (including co-managed devices) or a supported version of the Configuration Manager client with tenant attach enabled Have Windows diagnostic data enabled at the Required level or higher Have Windows diagnostic data enabled at the Required level or higher Have Windows Health Monitoring configured to include Windows Updates as part of the scope Have Windows Health Monitoring configured to include Windows Updates as part of the scope You must set the Enable features that require Windows diagnostic data in processor configuration setting within the Tenant administration > Connectors and tokens > Windows data to On. You must set the Enable features that require Windows diagnostic data in processor configuration setting within the Tenant administration > Connectors and tokens > Windows data to On. Endpoint analytics data collection must be enabled with \u2018optional\u2019 level set. Endpoint Analytics uses the Windows Connected User Experiences and Telemetry component (DiagTrack) to collect the data from Intune-managed devices. Endpoint analytics data collection must be enabled with \u2018optional\u2019 level set. Endpoint Analytics uses the Windows Connected User Experiences and Telemetry component (DiagTrack) to collect the data from Intune-managed devices. Data Source Intune reporting on specific device information requires data to be captured on the device and uploaded to Microsoft. This is the subset of the dataset Microsoft talks about in their\u2018Diagnostics, feedback, and privacy in Windows\u2019statement \u2013Diagnostics, feedback, and privacy in Windows \u2013 Microsoft Support. In short:\u201cMicrosoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the Tailored experiences setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to enhance Microsoft and third-party products and services for each customer\u2019s needs.\u201d Windows OS telemetry is processed by the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service, also known as \u2018DiagTrack\u2019 or Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). It\u2019s a built-in Windows service that collects and transmits anonymized data about user experience and device health to Microsoft. This data can include device specs, installed programs, basic error info, and Windows update details. Windows Connected User Experience and Telemetry / \u2018DiagTrack\u2019 service: The volume and type of telemetry data that the \u2018DiagTrack\u2019 service will process is determined by which of the four logging options are selected: Diagnostic data off (Security) Diagnostic data off (Security) Required diagnostic data (Basic) Required diagnostic data (Basic) Enhanced (This setting is only available on devices running Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019.) Enhanced (This setting is only available on devices running Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019.) Optional diagnostic data (Full) Optional diagnostic data (Full) We\u2019re not going to deep dive on each logging level, but instead recommend the following reading:Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organisation (Windows 10 and Windows 11) \u2013 Windows Privacy | Microsoft Learn Depending on the configured telemetry logging level, the data output is stored in encrypted files within%ProgramData%\\MicrosoftDiagnosisfolder. This location is not accessible by non-administrative users. The Connected User Experience and Telemetry / \u2018DiagTrack\u2019 service uploads data to Microsoft over an HTTPS connection. Additionally, Microsoft allows us to view the diagnostic data they collect in real time. \u2018Diagnostic Data Viewer\u2019 provides full visibility to the data collected and groups it into categories. The Diagnostic Data Viewer feature is disabled by default. Diagnostic Data Viewer Overview (Windows 10 and Windows 11) \u2013 Windows Privacy | Microsoft Learn The report parameters require selecting a \u2018Target OS\u2019 before generating the report. Target OS selection (as of June 2024): Once the OS target value is set, the report can be generated. In the top section of the report, a donut chart shows the devices grouped into \u2018Readiness Status\u2019 categories: Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk, Replace Device, Upgraded, and Unknown. In the bottom half of the report, a data table lists devices with various other columns, including basic device information and a few clues related to their readiness status. This report provides limited information about upgrade readiness. Similar to the Configuration Manager report output, there\u2019s no drill-through capability on any of the metrics on show. For example, you cannot drill down to any numerical value displayed in the \u2018App issues\u2019, \u2018Driver issues\u2019, or \u2018Other issues\u2019 columns to view more detailed information. Windows feature update compatibility risks report Like the \u2018Windows feature update device readiness report,\u2019 this also requires selecting a target OS before generating the report. The same target Windows OS options are listed again. The report output format follows the device readiness report too: there\u2019s donut chart and data table. The major difference with this report is that the focus is on the \u2018Risk Status.\u2019 The report provides additional details related to each \u2018Risk Status\u2019, specifically \u2018Low Risk,\u2019 \u2018Medium Risk,\u2019 and \u2018High Risk.\u2019 The data table does have click-through capabilities to display the affected devices related to the specific risk status. Click-through detail: Windows feature update compatibility risks report \u2013 Summary This report provides some insight into why Windows devices may not be compatible with an OS upgrade. Incompatible applications and drivers can be reported here, too. This is an improvement on the Windows 11 readiness dashboard in Configuration Manager, purely for the details on any blockers with incompatible applications and drivers. Windows \u2013 \u2018Work from anywhere\u2019 report This report focuses on the minimum system hardware requirements for Windows 11 and which devices are \u2018capable\u2019 or not, including details on the specific hardware blockers. Like the other reports, the data source relies on theWindows Connected User Experience and Telemetry / \u2018DiagTrack\u2019 service to process and upload data from the clients. There is a difference with this reportthough as, unlike the others, it leverages Endpoint Analytics. So as mentioned earlier, on-boarding to Endpoint Analytics is a requirement. There are a whole bunch of reports nested within the \u2018Work from anywhere\u2019 section that provide a comprehensive \u2018scoring\u2019 of the environment across various subcategories and an overall score, alongside insightful recommendations. The \u2018Windows\u2019 subreport provides the \u2018Windows 11 readiness status.\u2019 The page will display any hardware blockers: This is essentially what the Windows 11 readiness dashboard in Configuration Manager is; it provides the bare-bones output on hardware compatibility for Windows 11. The report does not have any click-through capabilities at all, and it also would be nice to have some \u2018actions\u2019 options based on the readiness state e.g. devices that equal \u2018capable\u2019 add those devices to a group or assign a feature update policy. Hardware Readiness PowerShell script Microsoft provides a standalone PowerShell script that can be executed on Windows devices to determine whether an individual device meets the system requirements for Windows 11. The script can be run locally from an elevated PowerShell session or across multiple devices in the enterprise, leveraging the device scripts feature in Microsoft Configuration Manager and Intune. The script uses standard PowerShell commands and modules like \u2018Get-WmiObject\u2019, \u2018Get-Tpm\u2019 etc to gather the devices hardware details including Storage, Memory, TPM, CPU, and SecureBoot. The script output uses a \u2018return code\u2019 value to set the readiness state. \u2018returnCode\u2019 -2FAILED TO RUN \u2013 the script encountered an error -2 FAILED TO RUN \u2013 the script encountered an error FAILED TO RUN \u2013 the script encountered an error -1UNDETERMINED \u2013 one or more of the hardware requirement checks failed to execute properly -1 UNDETERMINED \u2013 one or more of the hardware requirement checks failed to execute properly UNDETERMINED \u2013 one or more of the hardware requirement checks failed to execute properly 0CAPABLE \u2013 the device meets all assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements 0 CAPABLE \u2013 the device meets all assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements CAPABLE \u2013 the device meets all assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements 1NOT CAPABLE \u2013 the device does not meet one or more of the assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements 1 NOT CAPABLE \u2013 the device does not meet one or more of the assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements NOT CAPABLE \u2013 the device does not meet one or more of the assessed Windows 11 hardware requirements ThereturnResultproperty is a string value representation ofreturnCode. The possible results include: CAPABLE, NOT CAPABLE, UNDETERMINED, and FAILED TO RUN. Output example: This script does not do much else other than highlight any hardware blockers in the categories mentioned. Using your favourite web search engine, you\u2019ll also find that there are a plethora of PowerShell community efforts available, all providing different variations on this approach. Windows 11 OS Media \u2013 Compat Scan The Setup.exe process, when using Windows operating system media, includes the ability to check for system compatibility using the command line switch \u2018/Compat scan only.\u2019 This feature has existed for many years now. It has also been utilized in a few creative ways, including customizing Operating System upgrades using Configuration Manager by categorizing devices pre-upgrade. Using \u2018setup.exe /compat scanonly\u2019 uses the same data source approach as \u2018compattelrunner.exe\u2019; the Appraiser.sdb. When running the setup.exe command e.g. \u2018setup /auto upgrade /quiet /compat scanonly /copylogs C:\\tempCompatLogfile\u2019part of the setup process will determine whether the latest feature update has been applied, and, if not, the latest applicable version of the \u2018appraiser.sdb\u2019 database will be automatically downloaded.(Alternate_AppraiserData.cab).The processing rules for the appraiser remain the same, with the \u2018Appraiser_TelemetryRunList.xml\u2019 providing the rules of what to process. Summary Just as the \u2018CompatTelRunner\u2019 scheduled task creates bin files, the process during Windows Setup creates a set of XML and BIN files in the Panther folder and, if specified, the logs output path. The \u2018CompatData_\u2026\u2026 .xml\u2019 can show us the hardware blockers. In the output logs directory, we also have the \u2018setupact.log\u2019 and \u2018setuperr.log\u2019, which give us a more verbose view of the data. Overall, despite the fact that the data source (appraiser.sdb) is still somewhat a mystery in how it all fully works, there is sufficient data to improve the overall output. Final Thoughts The reporting solutions we\u2019ve covered here are lacking in many ways. Whether that\u2019s presentation, the lack of depth to the output, or just a bit cumbersome to use, the overall feeling is that the output should be much better given that the data depth is available. The\u2018Appriaser.sdb\u2019appears to have all the information you\u2019d want to know about OS upgrade blockers. Still, it\u2019s not entirely straightforward to parse, and there\u2019s little documentation around about its contents nor how the \u2018Appraiser_TelemetryRunList.xml\u2019is used to process it. Each report does at least cover the very basics to highlight hardware blockers, and the output quality is just about acceptable. Blocking information on applications and drivers is a bit inconsistent, with only the Intune reports providing real reliability. If only we could have a single report or dashboard that reliably shows all the Windows 11 readiness data (and more!), with click-through datasets that provide data depth without justcluesas to why an OS upgrade blocker exists.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/write-powershell-script/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to write a PowerShell script In this Knowledge Base (KB) article, we will guide you through the process of writing a PowerShell script, specifically focusing on creating a function. This function will help you automate a repeatable task, saving you time and effort. But first, some basics. What is Windows PowerShell Windows PowerShell is a task automation framework and a command-line shell developed by Microsoft. Windows PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework and supports cmdlets (pronounced \u201ccommand-lets\u201d), which are small, focused scripts or tools that perform a specific task. These cmdlets can be combined and reused to create more complex PowerShell scripts and automation workflows. What is a PowerShell script? PowerShell scripts are files that contain a series of PowerShell commands intended for scenarios like the automation of administrative tasks, configuration management and data processing. Tools used While tool selection is largely a matter of personal preference, I prefer using the following tools for writing, testing, and running scripts: Visual Studio Code \u2013Visual Studio Code \u2013 Code Editing. Redefined Visual Studio Code \u2013Visual Studio Code \u2013 Code Editing. Redefined The PowerShell plugin for Visual Studio Code \u2013PowerShell \u2013 Visual Studio Marketplace The PowerShell plugin for Visual Studio Code \u2013PowerShell \u2013 Visual Studio Marketplace Windows Terminal \u2013An overview on Windows Terminal | Microsoft Learn Windows Terminal \u2013An overview on Windows Terminal | Microsoft Learn Components of a PowerShell script Cmdlets PowerShell cmdlets, or commandlets, are specialized commands created for system administration and automation tasks. They tend to follow a naming convention of verb-noun (e.g., Get-Process or New-Item). Cmdlets perform very specific operations, and their output is generally structured as objects, allowing them to be easily combined using pipelines to chain multiple commands together. Examples includeGet-Process,Set-Location,Get-Help,Start-Service,Remove-ItemandGet-WmiObject Admins will generally use Cmdlets to perform ad hoc tasks, such as managing Active Directory users, Exchange mailboxes, Azure resources, Endpoint devices, etc. As an example, here is the CmdletGet-ADUserin use. You can find more examples of common PowerShell useshere Pipelines We can take Cmdlets and supercharge them by combining them with other Cmdlets through the use of the Pipeline. A pipeline is basically a series of commands connected together by the pipeline operator (|). Each time you add a pipeline, the results of the preceding command are forwarded to the next. As an example, let\u2019s get all processes usingGet-Process, assign the results to$highMemoryProcesses, pipe that to Where-Object to find processes consuming over 100MB of memory, sort by WorkingSet, and take the top 5 highest results. As another example, we can useGet-ChildItemto get the contents of a directory and pipe the results directly toSort-Objectto sort by the file length property. Variables: Variables allow you to store all types of values, such as the output of a pipeline operation or data you want to use in other cmdlets, such as file paths or values. There are a few different types of variables: user-defined, automatically defined, and preference variables. As an example$ErrorActionPreferencelets you instruct PowerShell what to do when there is a non-terminating error (an error that does not stop a cmdlet from executing) Possible values: Continue (default) \u2013 Displays the error and continues execution. Continue (default) \u2013 Displays the error and continues execution. Stop \u2013 Stops execution. Stop \u2013 Stops execution. SilentlyContinue \u2013 Suppresses the error message and continues execution. SilentlyContinue \u2013 Suppresses the error message and continues execution. Inquire \u2013 Asks for user input on how to proceed. Inquire \u2013 Asks for user input on how to proceed. Ignore \u2013 Ignores the error completely (PowerShell 7+). Ignore \u2013 Ignores the error completely (PowerShell 7+). When you start to move away from using single cmdlets, one line scripts and combine everything together into a script, it may sound scarier than it actually is. Very simply, a script is just the same commands you\u2019re already familiar with, bundled together and saved in a .PS1. These controls includeIf,Else,ForEach,For,Do(includingWhileandUntil),While,Break,ContinueandReturn. Functions The last piece of our PowerShell script puzzle is functions. With a function, you can take one-line cmdlets you regularly use, modify them, and make them more easily reusable. Writing functions lets you reuse your code across multiple scripts instead of rewriting the same thing repeatedly or even save them as modules, which enables you to call them in PowerShell without referencing them directly by their full path. Two critical things for a function are how to name it and its parameters, so let\u2019s look at those things! Naming Functions is important! They should follow the PascalCase style format and use an approved verb followed by a singular noun, e.g., Get-Version, Convert-Image, or Test-Binding. This is especially helpful for other people who may come across your function; a well-named function can immediately tell someone exactly what it does. You can find a full list of approved verbs by usingGet-Verb. Parameters let you expand your function, making it more fluid than static. If we look at another simple Hello World example, This function will write out \u201cHello, World!\u201d each time it is called. But if we expand the function to include a string parameter, we can have it do more! By adding a Name as a parameter, we can instruct the function to add a name to the output. Lastly, if we combine our parameter with an if statement, we can expand the functionality further to change the output depending on whether or not the parameter was used. You can also easily transform your simple function into an advanced function with CmdletBiding, SupportShouldProcess, Validation, Pipeline input, andError Handling, but we\u2019ll look at those in some examples later. Formatting I won\u2019t reinvent the wheel here, rules and recommendations for formatting PowerShell scripts are fairly standard and widely accepted, So lets take some advise from Don Jones, Matt Penny, Carlos Perez, Joel Bennett and the PowerShell Community. Let\u2019s look at what I believe to be the three most essential things in formatting. Consistency While the rules may differ between projects, the goal is to format code consistently. Always aim to stick to the style guidelines laid out in a project, or pick a style for your own projects and stick with it. Capitalization PowerShell isn\u2019t case-sensitive, but following capitalization conventions makes code easier to read. Microsoft created these conventions for .NET, and as PowerShell is based on .NET, they all. You can read more about these conventions here \u2013Capitalization Conventions \u2013 Framework Design Guidelines | Microsoft Learn, but tl;dr lowercase\u2013 all lowercase, no word separationKeywords likeforeachare written in lower case, as well as operators like-eqand-match lowercase\u2013 all lowercase, no word separation Keywords likeforeachare written in lower case, as well as operators like-eqand-match Keywords likeforeachare written in lower case, as well as operators like-eqand-match UPPERCASE\u2013 all capitals, no word separationKeywords in comment-based help are written in upper case for readability UPPERCASE\u2013 all capitals, no word separation Keywords in comment-based help are written in upper case for readability Keywords in comment-based help are written in upper case for readability PascalCase\u2013 capitalize the first letter of each wordPascalCase is used for all public identifiers.

Indentation Contrary to the style guide, Tabs not spaces. Going back to consistency, if you have a preference then stick with it or stick with the style of the project. Other things to think about CmdletBinding CmdletBinding Order of execution Order of execution Line length Line length Blank lines and Whitespace Blank lines and Whitespace Our first PowerShell script Before you can start writing PowerShell scripts, you really need to know what you want to do or what problem you are trying to solve. Let\u2019s take a problem I encountered recently. Converting images I encountered an issue where downloading images from the internet that had a file extension of .PNG were actually .JPG, and while that may not seem like that big of an issue, it can cause problems with app packaging for Intune. Go tohttps://cloudconvert.com/,right? No. Do it in PowerShell! If we break it down, I want to Take in an image path Take in an image path Take in an optional output path Take in an optional output path Take in a required output image type (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp or tiff) Take in a required output image type (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp or tiff) Import the image to a variable Import the image to a variable Check if an output path has been specifiedIf not, generate one Check if an output path has been specified If not, generate one If not, generate one Convert the image to the selected format Convert the image to the selected format Save it to the output path with the new file type Save it to the output path with the new file type Write out success or failure to the console Write out success or failure to the console The first thing we want to do is take in an image path, an optional output path, and a required output image type. Let\u2019s set up ourCmdletBindingand parameters. Firstly, we\u2019ve added aCmdletBindingto add Validation and Error Handling. Firstly, we\u2019ve added aCmdletBindingto add Validation and Error Handling. Now, let\u2019s add a mandatory parameter called$InputImagePathto specify which image to pull in. Now, let\u2019s add a mandatory parameter called$InputImagePathto specify which image to pull in. Then, we add a mandatory parameter called$OutputFormatto let us specify which format we want to convert our image to. We\u2019ve also added validation to ensure that the output format is an accepted format. Then, we add a mandatory parameter called$OutputFormatto let us specify which format we want to convert our image to. We\u2019ve also added validation to ensure that the output format is an accepted format. Lastly, we\u2019ve added a parameter called$OutputImagePathso that we can choose to specify an output path, but we don\u2019t have to as it isn\u2019t mandatory. Lastly, we\u2019ve added a parameter called$OutputImagePathso that we can choose to specify an output path, but we don\u2019t have to as it isn\u2019t mandatory. Now that we have everything we need to take in, Lets figure out processing. Before we go any further, we want to ensure that the $InputImagePath is provided. We can test the$InputImagePathusingTest-Path, and if it doesn\u2019t exist, we\u2019ll throw an error message. Throw will stop the execution of the script unless there is a try/catch block, which we\u2019ll come to shortly. Now, we need to do a little more validation to ensure that our output directory exists so that we can save our converted image later. We\u2019ll do this in 2 steps Check if our$OutputImagePathvariable was passedIf it wasn\u2019t, set the$OutputImagePathto the same directory as$InputImagePath.If$OutputImagePathwas specified, validate that it exists and is a valid path. Check if our$OutputImagePathvariable was passed If it wasn\u2019t, set the$OutputImagePathto the same directory as$InputImagePath. If it wasn\u2019t, set the$OutputImagePathto the same directory as$InputImagePath. If$OutputImagePathwas specified, validate that it exists and is a valid path. If$OutputImagePathwas specified, validate that it exists and is a valid path. If it is not a valid path, throw an errorIf it is a valid path, set it as our$OutputImagePath If it is not a valid path, throw an error If it is a valid path, set it as our$OutputImagePath If it is a valid path, set it as our$OutputImagePath Now that we have our$OutputImagePathset, we can start to work with our images. Now that we\u2019ve added some validation, we now need to start working with images. We can do this by usingAdd-Typeto load in theSystem.Drawingassembly which gives our script access to classes and methods used to manipulate images. OnceSystem.Drawingis imported, we can load our image from$InputImagePath, using theFromFile() method, into PowerShell to start manipulating it. With our image stored, we now need to set the output format, which we\u2019ll take from the required$OutputFormatparameter. I\u2019ve done this using a switch so we can see what is happening with the format variable, but we can shorten this to one line, as shown below. Here, I have condensed this to one line that takes$OutputFormatand sets it as our output file format. We can save our image once we have our $OutputImagePath and format! Does it work? Here, we can see two things. There is only one image file, called ThisIsA.png. There is only one image file, called ThisIsA.png. There are a several ways to run PowerShell scripts, but we\u2019lldot sourcethis one so that we can call our function in the scope of my terminal. There are a several ways to run PowerShell scripts, but we\u2019lldot sourcethis one so that we can call our function in the scope of my terminal. When we run our function, we pass in the required$InputImagePathand$OutputFormatparameters, and we can now see that we have a second file called ThisIsA.jpeg That\u2019s us all done, right? Well, it could be, but let\u2019s take it just one step further and look at error handling. While it may not seem like a big deal for a simple small function, but it multiple small functions in a large script with no error handling can make troubleshooting difficult. I\u2019ve added atry/catchblock around the Process section of my function, which lets me catch and handle different types of error. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be overly granular with your catches, but if you are, you can perform different actions depending on the type of exception. In my scenario, I\u2019m just going to write out a different error depending on the exception thrown. A try/catch is not complete without afinally. While this won\u2019t always be required, it\u2019s generally good practice to release the resources held by the object you were working with, in this case, our$image. So, after our catches, I\u2019ve added a check to see if our image variable is null. If it isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll dispose of it to release the resources it was using to store our image. I\u2019ve also added acomment-based helpsection to the top of our script, including a description, parameter details, examples, and notes. Note: You\u2019ll notice that I\u2019ve used a mixture ofPascalCaseandcamelCasein my script. I like to do this to differentiateParameters(PascaleCase) from variables (camelCase), but this is purely a personal preference. Finishing up This article is in no way the definitive guide to writing PowerShell scripts. You can write your scripts however you want, as long as they are readable, consistent, and formatted. While this blog focussed specifically on a PowerShell script that contained a single function, a PowerShell script can be made of up many functions, single line commands or even call other scripts!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/evaluating-microsoft-s-third-party/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Evaluating Microsoft\u2019s Third-Party Patching Solutions for Intune Here at Patch My PC, we are application obsessed. True, if you were to look at our workspaces, you would find crazy monitor configurations, keyboards that defy description, and \u2026 for reasons still unclear \u2026 a proliferation of rubber ducks. However, our obsession with applications rises above all others because that\u2019s what our customers are obsessed with. Ultimately, companies don\u2019t want hardware, infrastructure, or operating systems; they just want the applications that drive their business forward. Therefore, their management tools are only effective to the extent that they can deliver applications the users need when they need them. Intune is Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based endpoint management solution that companies worldwide use to deliver applications to their devices. Microsoft has recently announced or released several improvements for Third-Party application management via Intune that, as application obsessives, we wanted to dive into and learn about in this blog post. Microsoft Opens the Store to Win32 Apps The Microsoft Store was initially released as the Windows Store to deliver Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications. It was built to be where independent software vendors (ISVs) could officially publish, sell, and advertise their applications. Over time Microsoft has included other types of content, such as games and fonts but continued to keep out the content that enterprises most needed: Win32 apps. That is, applications delivered with traditional MSI or EXE installers. Excluding these types of apps limited the value of the Store as many software vendors lack the skill or determination to re-engineer their apps or installation methods to meet the Store restrictions. As our own packaging experts will attest: the actual installer is often an afterthought for most vendors. In May of 2022, Microsoftannouncedthat this restriction was globally removed, and all software vendors were now free to publish their MSI or EXE-based installers to the Store. The floodgates were now open! Microsoft Deprecates the Store for Business and Education To provide enterprise control for the public Microsoft Store, organizations could use the Microsoft Store for Business (MSfB) or Microsoft Store for Education (MSfE) to only deliver a curated set of apps to their users. Both tools became widely adopted and were integrated into Intune to allow administrators to manage both Stores from the same tool they used to manage other non-Store apps. In July 2021, Microsoftannouncedthat both Microsoft Store for Business and Education would be deprecated on March 31, 2023. While Microsoft has pushed that date back indefinitely, the Intune integrations with both Stores will start being removed on April 30, 2023, and completely shut down by September 15, 2023 (here). Microsoft Integrates Intune with Windows Package Manager (Winget) In 2020 Microsoft announcedWindows Package Manager(WPM) to relatively little fanfare. Windows Package Manager was designed to mimic package managers available in nearly every Linux distribution that make it easy to install and update applications from a trusted repository. Part of WPM is a command-line tool and software libraries called Winget which facilitate interacting with the application repositories. There are several repositories available: the Microsoft Store repository representing official software vendor packages, private repositories maintained by third parties, and a community repository that allows submissions for any app from anyone (here). Long after announcing deprecation of the Microsoft Store for Business and Education Microsoft eventuallyannouncedthat Intune would integrate Windows Package Manager/Winget to deliver Microsoft Store apps from the official Microsoft Store repository to the Customer Portal. Note that Intune\u2019s Windows Package Manager integration currently only supports Windows Store apps. Support for private repositories is planned, but no plans exist to integrate Intune with Windows Package Manager\u2019s community application repository. Once installed, the Intune Management Extension (IME) will periodically update managed applications to the latest version. What are the Limitations? While all the above is exciting to us application nerds, certain limitations should be considered before adoption. When you initially deploy a Microsoft Store app with Intune, you can configure installation deadlines to control the rollout. Once deployed, however, there is no control over version or update timing. The Intune Management Extension will continually update the applications to their latest randomly and uncontrollably. You cannot keep apps at a specific version nor revert the applications to an earlier release if a new release causes issues. Intune\u2019s Windows Package manager integration excludes age-restricted or paid Store applications, which will not be returned in searches. In the example below, the HEVC Video Extensions application is available in the Store for $0.99 but is not returned as a search result. You can work around this limitation however by searching for the Microsoft store app\u2019s ID. While this workaround is currently valid there\u2019s been no commitment from Microsoft that this is \u2018by design\u2019 and will not be removed at a later date. The Microsoft Store is intended to contain applications officially published by the vendor that owns the application. However, as the 7-Zip example shows above, that\u2019s not the case: Zeeis is not the owner of 7-zip. In fact, there are multiple 7-Zip applications in the Store, all of which are unofficial, not guaranteed to be what they say they are, and certainly not guaranteed to be updated in a timely fashion, if at all. When an application is officially published into the Store by the vendor you are still dependent upon them for updating the Store app in timely manner to stay current. There is no meaningful Service Level Agreement here. Intune Suite: Advanced App Management In addition to Store integration, Microsoft has been working to create its own Third-Party Patching service to be included in the Intune Suite ($120/user/year). This service will be based on an Enterprise App Catalog containing an unspecified number of applications verified and hosted by Microsoft. This new service is integrated directly into Intune and will deliver applications using Intune\u2019s existing Win32 application features, including supersedence. When importing and updating the application, you can review the application details and modify a subset of properties such as install command, uninstall command, and restart behavior. The initial release of Advanced App Management will not support automatically updating applications. Instead, a pane in Intune, tentatively namedUpdates for Windows Advanced management apps, will list available updates for your managed applications. You can drill down into the update from this screen to get additional information, including how many devices require it. Then, by clickingUpdate application, you can import the application update into Intune and manually deploy it. From then on, the update will act like any other Intune Win32 application. Wait, isn\u2019t Third-Party Patching Kind of Your Thing? It is! Thank you for noticing. When we look at Microsoft\u2019s latest attempts in this space, we find ourselves unconcerned and welcoming of our new competitor. At Patch My PC, we have the best team in the business obsessed with a singular goal: to simplify how enterprises create, manage, update, and deploy third-party applications. We provide a proper end-to-end automated solution for Third-Party applications and a level of customization and control not offered by the abovementioned solutions. Our game plan is simple: provide the absolute best solution at an affordable price backed by the best support possible. Call us crazy, and the rubber duck thing gives a certain credence to that label, but we think that\u2019s a winning strategy.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-management-extension-esp-phases/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Under the hood of the IME: The ESP Phases Explained! Have you ever had apps that just refuse to uninstall because theIntune Management Extension (Microsoft IME)insists the device is stuck in theEnrollment Status Page (ESP) Account Setup phase? This blog explores that exact frustration, breaking down how the Microsoft IME tracks theEnrollment Status Page ESP phasesand what happens when it thinks a device hasn\u2019t left Account Setup. We\u2019ll also uncover the inner mechanics of ESP checks and reveal the secrets behindEnrollmentStatusTracking CSPand WMI calls. Introduction: A Deep Dive into the ESP Phases It all started with a Reddit post: a user was struggling with Hybrid Join devices perpetually stuck in the ESP Account Setup phase. What initially seemed like a simple issue with app uninstalls quickly revealed something deeper. This post piqued my curiosity\u2014not just because of the stuck apps (Apps not being uninstalled), but because multiple attempts to fix the problem hadn\u2019t moved the devices past AccountSetup. I realized this case might expose fundamental insights into how the Enrollment Status Page (Microsoft ESP) integrates with the Intune Management Extension (Microsoft IME) to handle device provisioning and tracking. This raised essential questions about how ESP determines app installation status, the roles of WMI and CSPs in setup, and how uninstall issues (like those this Reddit user faced) impact flow. This led me to dissect ESP\u2019s intricate checks and IME interactions, which I\u2019ll break down here to give you the full picture. Now, let\u2019s examine these checks and dive deep into ESP\u2019s flow to understand how to spot where things might go wrong. ESP Phases and IME: Gatekeepers of Apps The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) is the mechanism that ensures a device completes critical setup steps (like app installs/PowerShell scripts, and policies) before users gain full access to the desktop environment. The IME, meanwhile, is responsible for managing Win32 app installations and PowerShell scripts on Intune-managed devices. The Intune Management Extension (IME)relies on the GetEspPhase function and the CheckDeviceAndAccountSetupStateWithWmi to identify the current ESP phase. To determine if a device is ready, theCheckDeviceAndAccountSetupStateWithWmiIME function examines specific registry entries and settings, including the sidecar CSP provider, which reflects the device\u2019s readiness and phase state. If ESP and IME fall out of sync, like in the Reddit case, the device can become \u201cstuck\u201d in AccountSetup, even post-enrollment. After noticing the IME was stuck in the Account Setup, my first idea was to use theGet-AutopilotDiagnosticstool. Get-AutopilotDiagnostics When the ESP phase decided to get stuck, I pulled outGet-AutopilotDiagnostics, a PowerShell script that\u2019s solid for capturing what\u2019s happening under the hood during Autopilot provisioning. This tool provides you with comprehensive information on ESP stages, device details, policy progress, and even app installation statuses. If an app or policy stalls out,Get-AutopilotDiagnosticswill usually flag it for you. But here\u2019s the twist: while the script should usually help when your Autopilot enrollment fails, it didn\u2019t reveal the whole story this time around. When running the get-autopilotdiagnostics script, it showed me that the device ESP was still enabled, while the IME Appworkload.log told me the device was in the account setup? If you want to know how to use the get-autopilotdiagnostics tool to troubleshoot your Autopilot enrollment, please read this blog:Get-AutopilotDiagnostics | Troubleshooting Autopilot Issues Besides the mention of the Device ESP being enabled, it didn\u2019t show me anything more useful. The specific interactions between the Intune Management Extension and the ESP phases ran a bit deeper than what Get-AutopilotDiagnostics could uncover. Still, it\u2019s a significant first step if you\u2019re troubleshooting Autopilot or ESP issues and need a snapshot of what\u2019s working (or not) in real-time. Digging Deeper into IME ESP Phases Behavior As I dug deeper, it became clear that IME wasn\u2019t just stuck; it thought the device was trapped in the ESP AccountSetup phase, effectively blocking critical uninstalls. This is where things got interesting: tracking how IME\u2019s ESP checks interacted with app installations and policies showed that something was definitely off. When we started investigating, it became clear that the Microsoft IME thought the device was stuck in the ESP AccountSetup phase, blocking required uninstalls. If you\u2019re familiar with the Get Esp Phases flow, it will make sense; let me explain. After asking the OP a few questions, we determined that the FirstSync key (holding the user\u2019s SID) was missing. If thefirstsynckey is missing, the IME couldn\u2019t confirm the initial user provisioning. (IsSyncDone) Besides the firstsync key totally missing, the persistent sidecar key also kept IME in \u201cin ESP.\u201d The solution? I asked the OP to Delete the sidecar key. After deleting the key, a reboot, and letting the IME recheck, it showed \u201cNotInEsp\u201d in the logs With the IME no longer thinking it was in the AccountPhase, the uninstalls started working. Cool, problem solved, right? As mentioned in the introduction, this issue sparked my curiosity about how the IME attempts to detect the correct Microsoft ESP Phase. (NotInesp/DevicePreparation/DeviceSetup/AccountSetup) Shall we focus on that important part now that the issue has been fixed? Get ESP Phases IME Flow Understanding the whole ESP flow is critical for troubleshooting why devices appear stuck. Here\u2019s the process ESP follows to verify whether a device is ready for full access. Below, you will find the corresponding description of each step in the process. 1.Start \u2013 Check Esp Phases Description: Begins the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) phase check to determine if the device should proceed through the ESP process. Code Reference:EspHelper.CheckEspPhase 2.Is OS Version 19H1 or Later? Description: Checks if the OS version is 19H1 or newer, as ESP is only supported on OS versions 19H1 and above. Code Reference:EnvironmentHelper.Is19H1OrLaterBuild() Outcome: If No, proceed to Step 3. 3.Return NotInEsp if OS < 19H1 Description: Ends the ESP flow if the OS version is too old to support ESP. Outcome: ESP process ends with the device marked asNotInEsp. 4.Found FirstSync Key? Description: Checks for the existence of the FirstSync registry key to verify if initial provisioning has started. Registry Path:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments<GUID>FirstSync Outcome: If No, proceed to Step 5. 5.Check Device Provisioning in First Sync Description: Validates device provisioning status directly from registry entries if the FirstSync key is not found. Registry Path:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments\\ Outcome: If provisioning is found, proceed to Step 6; otherwise, proceed to Step 21. 6.Skip Device and User Status Pages? Description: Checks if bothSkipDeviceStatusPageandSkipUserStatusPageare set, meaning the ESP should be skipped. Registry Path:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments<GUID>FirstSyncSkipDeviceStatusPageandSkipUserStatusPage Outcome: If Yes, ESP ends at Step 7; if No, continue to Step 8. 7.Return NotInEsp if Skipping Both Pages Description: Ends ESP if both device and user pages are skipped. Outcome: ESP process ends with the device marked asNotInEsp. 8.IsSyncDone if SkipUserStatusPage == No Description: Determines if synchronization is complete based on whether the User Status page was skipped. Outcome: If Yes, flow exits with NotInEsp status; if No, proceed to Step 9. 9.Check SidecarCSP Provider State Description: Checks the status of the SidecarCSP provider to track device readiness for provisioning. CSP Path:./Vendor/MSFT/EnrollmentStatusTracking/DevicePreparation/PolicyProviders/Sidecar Code Reference:EspHelper.GetSidecarProviderState 10.Sidecar Provider State \u2013 NotInstalled / NotRequired / Completed Description: Validates the installation state of SidecarCSP. Outcome:NotInstalled: Proceed to Step 11.NotRequired: Ends with Step 14.Completed: Proceed to Step 15. NotInstalled: Proceed to Step 11. NotRequired: Ends with Step 14. Completed: Proceed to Step 15. 11.Set SidecarProvider State to Completed Description: Updates the state of SidecarCSP toCompletedto signal that Sidecar requirements are met. CSP Path:./Vendor/MSFT/EnrollmentStatusTracking/DevicePreparation/PolicyProviders/Sidecar Code Reference:EspHelper.SetSidecarProviderState 12.Track Resource Types \u2013 Apps Description: Configures tracked resource types under Sidecar to include apps for tracking purposes. CSP Path:./Vendor/MSFT/EnrollmentStatusTracking/DevicePreparation/PolicyProviders/Sidecar/TrackedResourceTypes Code Reference:EspHelper.SetSidecarProviderTrackedResourceTypes 13.Enter DeviceSetup ESP Phase Description: Sets the device to theDeviceSetupphase to continue provisioning at the device level. Outcome: Continue to Step 15. 14.Return NotInEsp if Sidecar Not Required Description: Ends ESP if Sidecar is marked asNotRequired. Outcome: ESP process ends with the device marked asNotInEsp. 15.Check Device Setup State with WMI Description: Checks the provisioning state of the device through WMI for device and account setups. CSP Path:MDM_EnrollmentStatusTracking_Setup01 Code Reference:EspHelper.CheckDeviceAndAccountSetupStateWithWmi 16.Device Provisioning Completed & Policies Created? Description: Checks bothHasProvisioningCompletedandTrackingPoliciesCreatedflags in Sidecar. CSP Path:./Vendor/MSFT/EnrollmentStatusTracking/DevicePreparation/PolicyProviders/Sidecar Code Reference:EspHelper.GetHasProvisioningCompletedandGetSidecarTrackingPoliciesCreated Outcome: If complete, proceed to Step 21; otherwise, continue to Step 17. 17.Check Device-Level Tracking Apps Description: Retrieves the installation state of tracked apps at the device level. CSP Path:MDM_EnrollmentStatusTracking_Tracking03_02 Code Reference:EspHelper.GetTrackingApps 18.Are All Device Apps Installed? Description: Verifies if all tracked apps marked for device installation are fully installed. Registry Path:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments<GUID>FirstSync Outcome: If Yes, continue to Step 20; if No, go to Step 19. 19.Device Setup Phase if Apps Pending Description: Device remains in the DeviceSetup phase if apps are still in progress or NotInstalled. Outcome: Loops back to Step 13 to re-check status. 20.Provisioning Completion Check Description: Ensures all apps are installed and checks if provisioning has fully completed. Code Reference:EspHelper.GetHasProvisioningCompleted Outcome: If complete, proceed to Step 21. 21.Proceed to AccountSetup Phase Description: Moves toAccountSetupto initiate user-level provisioning. Outcome: Continue to Step 22. 22.Account Provisioning Check Description: Checks account provisioning andTrackingPoliciesCreatedflag at the account level. CSP Path:MDM_EnrollmentStatusTracking_Tracking03_02 Code Reference:EspHelper.GetSidecarTrackingPoliciesCreated 23.Check Account-Level Tracking Apps Description: Retrieves the installation state of tracked apps for the account. CSP Path:MDM_EnrollmentStatusTracking_Tracking03_02 Code Reference:EspHelper.GetTrackingApps 24.Are All Account Apps Installed? Description: Verifies if all account-specific tracked apps are fully installed. Outcome: If Yes, proceed to Step 25. 25.Return NotInEsp if All Apps Done Description: Ends ESP once all apps for both device and account have completed installation. Outcome: ESP process ends with the device marked asNotInEsp. Summary of Critical Keys and Expected Values for ESP Completion To ensure that a device exits theEnrollment Status Page (ESP)as completed, the following registry keys and values should exist and be correctly set. This table also includes details on how ESP behaves if certain keys, like the Sidecar CSP, are missing. Besides this overview I also need to add something intriguing because if somehow theHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Enrollments\\<GUID>\\FirstSync\\<UserSID>is missing, you could configure the isserverprovisioningdone back to zero and sync the device After syncing the device, the OMADMClient would recreate that usersid folder and would mark the user provisioning as done ESP Phases Takeaways This Reddit case revealed some crucial insights into the IME and ESP relationship. By identifying how TrackingPoliciesCreated and FirstSync influence the IME\u2019s GetEspPhase function, we saw firsthand how a few registry adjustments can unlock devices stuck in AccountSetup. It\u2019s a reminder that understanding these internals is key to troubleshooting Intune issues efficiently. Are you curious to try it yourself?

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-autopilot-reset-vs-remote-wipe/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Windows Autopilot Reset vs. Intune Remote Wipe I started writing this blog after posting a poll on LinkedIn to find out who was using Windows Autopilot Reset or the Intune Remote Wipe to reset an existing device before we handed it over to a new employee. Introduction Let\u2019s start with a proper introduction first. When giving an existing device to a new employee, IT administrators must choose the best way to prepare it. Two main options areWindows Autopilot Reset and Intune Remote Wipe. Each method has its features and benefits, making it useful in different situations. Autopilot Reset is designed to quickly restore the device to its original state without really reinstalling the operating system. This efficient option removes all previous user data and settings while keeping essential configurations and applications intact. It\u2019s ideal for scenarios where the device needs to be redeployed quickly with minimal downtime. On the other hand, Intune Remote Wipe completely erases all device data, settings, and configurations. This method ensures that the device is entirely clean, providing a fresh start for the new user. It is particularly useful in situations where security is a high priority and there is a need to ensure no residual data from the previous user remains on the device. This blog will explore both methods in detail, examining how they work and their respective results. By understanding the processes and outcomes of each approach, you can determine which option is best suited for your needs. Whether you need a quick turnaround or a clean slate, we\u2019ll help you make an informed decision. Introduction to Windows Autopilot Reset Windows Autopilot Reset is designed to prepare a device for a new user quickly. It removes personal files, settings, and apps while maintaining the device\u2019s identity and settings in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune. This method leverages theautomatic redeployment CSP, allowing the device to be reset without reinstalling the operating system, making it faster and less bandwidth-intensive than a full wipe. Key features of Windows Autopilot Reset include: Retention of Device Identity:The device remains enrolled in Azure AD and Intune, preserving its identity and management capabilities. Speed:The reset process is quicker since it doesn\u2019t involve reinstallation of the OS. For more information, you can refer to the officialWindows Autopilot Reset documentationand theWindows Autopilot Reset overview. Introduction to Intune Remote Wipe Intune Remote Wipe is a more comprehensive method designed to remove all user data, settings, and apps from a device. This action reinstalls the operating system, ensuring that all personal data is thoroughly removed. While this process is more time-consuming than an Autopilot Reset, it effectively wipes the device, providing a higher level of data security. Key features of Intune Remote Wipe include: Comprehensive Data Removal:This ensures all user data, settings, and apps are wiped from the device. Reinstallation of OS:The process involves reinstalling the operating system, providing a clean slate for the following user. Data Security:Offers a higher level of data security by ensuring the complete removal of all personal data. For detailed information, visit theIntune Remote Wipe documentation. Comparing Autopilot Reset and Intune Remote Wipe A quick comparison between Windows Autopilot reset and the Intune Remote Wipe feature. Windows Autopilot Reset: Speed:Generally faster than Intune Remote Wipe because it does not reinstall the operating system. Use Case:Suitable for quickly preparing devices for new users in environments where data security is managed through other means. Intune Remote Wipe: Speed:Takes longer due to the reinstallation of the operating system. Data Handling:This ensures that all data is wiped from the device, providing higher security by removing all personal data and settings. Use Case:Ideal for scenarios requiring high data security and ensuring all previous user data is completely removed. Detailed Look into the Intune Remote Wipe Process Let\u2019s start with an overview of what happens during theIntune Remote Wipe Processaka the reset scenario. To give a brief summary of the steps above: Initiation:The wipe is triggered through the Intune portal. Initiation:The wipe is triggered through the Intune portal. Data Removal:Before starting the whole process, it will check if the wipeData marker is set. Data Removal:Before starting the whole process, it will check if the wipeData marker is set. With thewipeDatamarker set, the device removes all user data, settings, and apps, including a secure erase of all data volumes. Operating System Reinstallation:After data removal, the device reinstalls the operating system, ensuring a clean slate. Post-Wipe State:The device will be left with a fresh operating system installation with no residual user data. I guess we are all pretty familiar with those steps, right? Especially with the Windows.Old saga that left the Windows.old folder on the disk with all the previous user\u2019s important data in it Windows 21H2 | Data Wipe Command leaves User Data on disk (call4cloud.nl) Luckily, Microsoft fixed that pretty fast, and with it, we could be pretty sure that the data was clean before handing it over to the next user! The Autopilot Reset Process With the Intune remote wipe process covered, let\u2019s find out what happens when we want to perform a remote Windows Autopilot reset in the Intune portal. When performing a reWindows Autopilot Reset, the process uses theautomaticredeployment CSPto reset the device. A fun fact: Besides clicking on the Autopilot reset button in Intune, we can also perform an exec command for that same CSP using the SyncMl tool. When leveraging this tool and the automatic redeployment CSP, we can perform a local Windows Autopilot reset! The Autopilot Reset Process in detail. The overview below shows what happens when we perform an exec to thedoAutomaticRedeployment csp. From top to bottom, this is the flow it goes through. When examining the flow above, two things likely stand out. The first one is the PreserveMDM and RestoreMDM functions. When I noticed those two functions, I decided to take a closer look at them. As shown above, it certainly looks like preserving the MDM settings is all about backing up the Intune MDM certificate by storing it in the mdmconfig.dat so it can be restored later in the process. However, there is something very important missing in the flow, especially when I look back at the first sentence of this blog: \u201cWhen giving an existing device to a new employee,\u201d Windows Autopilot Reset indeed mentions that it removes personal files, apps, and settings. Now comes the bad news! Autopilot Reset doesNOTformat/wipe the drive like the Intune Remote Wipe orFresh Start(SignatureReset) would do Since the device does not perform a thorough wipe, previous root folders with potentially crucial data are not removed from the autopilot device. Oww, another but!! But that\u2019s not even the biggest issue here. TheAutomicRedeployment(Reprovioning scenario) also leaves something else lingering on the device! Yes!!! As shown above, it\u2019s pretty clear that the Windows.old folder with the previous user\u2019s data is still there! Conclusion Choosing between Windows Autopilot Reset and Intune Remote Wipe depends on your organization\u2019s needs. If you need to prepare devices quickly and can handle data security in other ways, Windows Autopilot Reset could be an option. It resets the device fast, keeping the MDM enrollment, settings, and apps, but the old user data still lingers, which is, in my opinion, very bad! Intune Remote Wipe is a much better option if removing all user data completely is very important, especially for strict security. This method wipes everything from the device, making it like new for the next user account.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/no-match-was-found-while-installing-the-nuget-packageprovider/", "title": "", "raw_text": "No Match was Found While Installing the NuGet PackageProvider? This blog will show you what happens when runningInstall PackageProvider -Name NuGetgives you the \u201cno match was found\u201derror. This time it wasn\u2019t the network or the source. The real issue was a certificate that expired earlier that day. We\u2019re going to zoom in on how PowerShell handles this, why it fails without providing any helpful information, and how to work around it. No Match Was Found When enrolling a device with Windows Autopilot, the hardware hash needs to be uploaded. If the vendor didn\u2019t do it for you, you\u2019ll have to handle it yourself. That usually means running: Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force This installs the script from the PowerShell Gallery, allowing you to use it to export the hardware hash and upload it to Intune automatically with the -online switch. But this time, it didn\u2019t work. PowerShell threw an error saying the NuGet package provider was missing. So I decided to install the NuGet package provider manually: Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force That\u2019s where it got annoying. Instead of installing NuGet, PowerShell gave a vague warning: WARNING: Unable to download from URI \u2018https://onegetcdn.azureedge.net/providers/nuget-2.8.5.208.package.swidtag\u2019 to \u201d. WARNING: Unable to download the list of available providers. Check your internet connection. Install-PackageProvider: No match was found for the specified search criteria for the provider \u2018NuGet\u2019. There it is. Theno match was founderror that shows up when something quietly breaks in the background. No real explanation. Just PowerShell refusing to say what actually went wrong. And yes, it had something to do with trust. Opening the OneGetCDN AzureEdge URL I opened the OneGetCDN AzureEdge.net URL manually in the browser. The page didn\u2019t load. Just a certificate warning, mentioning that your connection isn\u2019t private. Besides the usual \u201cyour connection is not private\u201d warning, the real reason was just below the error.NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID.The certificate had expired. No surprise everything broke but PowerShell never mentioned it. So we Clicked the padlock \u2013> Certificate details. There it was: the certificate expiredtoday: June 11, 2025, at 2:11 AM. Issued by Let\u2019s Encrypt, still being served by the CDN. And well\u2026 we all know what happens when the certificate isn\u2019t valid, no communication, no download, nothing. PowerShell didn\u2019t log anything about the cert, it just failed and showed the generic \u201cno match\u201d error. Confirming with Fiddler To be sure, I opened Fiddler and ran the same NuGet install command again.Fiddlerconfirmed it: A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock. To ignore the issue, we clicked \u201cIgnore errors and proceed,\u201d and theNuGet Packageproviderdownloaded and installed just fine. The AzureEdge endpoint was reachable. The swidtag file was valid. The only issue was that the certificate had expired a few hours ago, and PowerShell refused to touch it. If you want to see how Fiddler helps with issues like this, the first Patch N Rant episode covers it: Skipping the Cert Check in PowerShell With Fiddler showing me it was possible to download and install the Nuget Packageprovider, I decided to try to create a workaround for PowerShell. As shown below this PowerShell script will bypass the certificate check: Then ran:Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force This time it worked. Followed by: Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo The Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo Script downloaded, hash collected, device could now be enrolled with Windows Autopilot. Why we got No match was Found with NuGet The certificate expired a few hours earlier. PowerShell uses System.Net.WebRequest. If TLS validation fails, it doesn\u2019t show a proper error, just a vague output like \u201cunable to download\u201d or \u201cno match found for the provider \u2018NuGet\u2019.\u201d No hint it was a certificate problem. No TLS warning. Just silence. Meanwhile, the browser showed the real issue. Fiddler confirmed it. PowerShell? Nothing. Microsoft Fixing the Certificate After posting this blog on X and LinkedIn, it seems Azure Support got out of bed and renewed the certificate! As shown below, Microsoft just renewed the Certificate of azureedge.net. With the Certificate renewed, downloading and installing the nuget packageprovider was no longer ending up with a package was not found error but succeeded! Wrap-up If you\u2019re onboarding a device and PowerShell tells you that\u201cno match was found for the provider \u2018NuGet\u2019\u201d, don\u2019t trust the message. It might not be a missing package, it might be an invalid certificate/Certificate Expired. The browser showed the cert expired. Fiddler caught and handled the TLS failure by ignoring it. PowerShell ignored both and didn\u2019t show a good error. Temporarily bypassing the certificate check allowed NuGet to install and the script to run. That was enough to complete the onboarding of the device.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/fixing-personal-data-encryption-error/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Fixing Personal Data Encryption Error 0x80070043 This blog dives into an issue we encountered after enablingPersonal Data Encryption (PDE).While it worked perfectly at first, trying to run an executable from a protected path brought up error0x80070043. It wasn\u2019t a network issue, but something else. Let\u2019s explore what\u2019s going on and how to work around it. Introduction When using bothPersonal Data Encryption (PDE)andLocal Administrator Protection, certain workflows, like running an executable from your Desktop, can unexpectedly fail. You might see a Windows Security prompt, but after logging in, the process doesn\u2019t complete successfully and throws errors such as 0x80070043. This isn\u2019t a network problem but a conflict between how these two security features operate. Let\u2019s break down why this happens and what you can do about it. Recap: What is Personal Data Encryption? Personal Data Encryption (PDE)protects your known folders and files by tying access to your user Windows Hello credentials. It keeps your sensitive data safe by encrypting folders like Desktop and Documents, ensuring that only you can open them. If another account or process tries to access these files, it won\u2019t succeed without the appropriate keys, and access will be denied! Let\u2019s move on and do a small recap of the Local Administrator Protection feature before diving into the issue itself. Enter Local Administrator Protection Windows 11\u2019s Local Administrator Protectionis all about securing the admin account itself. Instead of free-floating admin rights, it isolates the admin token. When something needs admin permissions, it creates a temporary \u201cshadow admin,\u201d separating those elevated rights from the rest of the system. This is great for security, but it is less great for compatibility. The Perfect Storm: PDE + Local Administrator Protection Here\u2019s where things go sideways. Let\u2019s examine what is happening. The Protected Path Problem PDE encrypts folders like your Desktop, so only your user account can access them. That\u2019s fine until you try to run something like an installer, which often requires a bit of elevation before you are allowed to run it. Elevation Changes the Game When you hit that\u201cRun as Administrator\u201dbutton, Local Administrator Protection steps in. It raises the Windows Security prompt and temporarily switches to a hidden admin token to elevate the process. The0x80070043 errormessage After you log in through the prompt, the executable tries to run, but it can\u2019t access its own location because it\u2019s locked away by PDE. Windows throws an error,0x80070043, or \u201cThe network name cannot be found.\u201d The funny thing is that there are no network issues; the file is just blocked. Here\u2019s the catch: that hidden shadow admin doesn\u2019t have access to your encryption keys. PDE sees this new admin as a stranger and says, \u201cNope, you\u2019re not getting in.\u201d With it, the shadow admin will be denied access to the file, and you will get the 0x80070043 error code. We can also spot the same behavior from an elevated cmd. This elevated cmd runs as the shadow admin user: admin_rudy. The result? A file stuck in no-man\u2019s-land, and you stuck troubleshooting. Why This Matters This issue isn\u2019t limited to the text crawler installer! It affects any scenario where an executable in a PDE-protected path requires elevation. PDE assumes the same user context will handle everything (using the session key to decrypt the file), while Local Administrator Protection works in a completely isolated space. As shown above, when using the cipher tool from an elevated CMD (which is run in an isolated space as admin_rudy) we can spot the fact, that it is not able to decrypt the file. Without having the option to decrypt the file, we can\u2019t open it. Workarounds for 0x80070043 Here\u2019s what you can do if you hit this issue when trying to open an executable that has been protected with Personal Data Encryption, and you are using Local administrator protection. 1. Moving the file to a Non-Protected Paths? We could try moving the executable to a folder that isn\u2019t protected by PDE, such as C:\\temp, before running it. But guess what happens? The file and its protection will be moved. 2. Disable Local Administrator Protection? If PDE-protected paths frequently cause issues, consider disabling Local Administrator Protection in affected environments. This reduces security but avoids these conflicts. (Not advised!!) 3. Modify Workflows Adapt workflows to avoid storing or running elevated processes directly from PDE-protected paths.(as moving isn\u2019t going to work) 4. Decrypting the file We could ask (or do it ourselves) the user to use the cipher command to decrypt the file, as shown below. If we had a GUI, this could be a good option but without it\u2026. nope\u2026. so for now, the only real solution is to ensure you are saving the file to a location which is not protected by PDE. Impact Beyond Local Administrator Protection This isn\u2019t just about PDE or Local Administrator Protection. Other Intune Suite tools like Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) could also experience the same issue when they are trying to access the file if it\u2019s placed inside a folder protected by personal data encryption. As shown above, when trying to elevate an executable from the desktop with EPM, we will experience the same error! Access Denied (error code 0x80070005 (-2147024891) Conclusion Personal Data Encryption and Local Administrator Protection (and epm) are both solid features but together? They could give you some challenges. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself staring at error codes and wondering why your files feel locked away even from you, now you know. Hopefully, Microsoft will smooth out these rough edges, but until then, at least we\u2019ve got some workarounds.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remove-built-windows-apps-powershell/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Remove Built-In Windows Apps: Clean Up Without the Chaos Removing the built-in (sometimes even unwanted) Windows Apps after an Autopilot deployment seems pretty straightforward. Just fire up PowerShell, run a few commands to uninstall the built-in Windows 10/11 Apps for all users, and watch the clutter disappear. But what happens when a single misstep breaks your whole device? This blog isn\u2019t just about removing apps with PowerShell (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get to that). It\u2019s about dodging those \u201coopsie\u201d moments, digging into the risks, and exploring smarter options, like using the Uninstall feature in the Store or leveraging AppLocker, App Control for Business (WDAC) to keep your deployment both clean and fully functional. Remove Windows 10/11 built-in Windows Apps: The Good, The Bad, and The Dangerous. Windows Autopilot promises a clean and seamless deployment experience, but let\u2019s be honest: it doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re staring at a pile of stuckpreinstalled apps, wondering who thought Solitaire or Weather was a critical business tool. The knee-jerk reaction? Fire up PowerShell, type Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-appxpackage, and start deleting everything in sight for the logged-in user. But before you press enter, let\u2019s discuss what can go wrong, because it will if you\u2019re not careful. This blog isn\u2019t just another guide to removing Windows 10 apps with PowerShell. It\u2019s aboutunderstanding what you\u2019re removing, avoiding the classic Dunning-Kruger trap, and learning smarter, safer alternatives to get the job done. Keep reading if you\u2019re ready to declutter your deployment without breaking everything. Stop! Before You Remove All Built-In Apps with PowerShell\u2026 Let\u2019s dive into the risks of going scorched-earth on built-in Windows apps. Sure, PowerShell commands like Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers and Remove-AppxPackage make it simple to uninstall those unwanted Windows apps, but not all apps or services should be tampered with. For example (a good one also). Do you think it is a good idea to execute this command: Get-AppxPackageMicrosoft.WindowsStore| Remove-AppxPackage ? Cleanup scripts often go beyond their intended purpose, targeting services that might seem obsolete but are anything but. Take dmwappushservice, for example, a service critical for telemetry and Intune functionality. Removing it under the assumption it\u2019s unnecessary can wreak havoc, leaving you with compliance failures and broken provisioning flows. Removing built-in apps isn\u2019t inherently bad; it\u2019s removing them blindly, and that\u2019s the problem. Understanding Remove-AppxPackage vs. Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage If you still want to clean up all of those pesty Windows Default apps with PowerShell, you\u2019ve probably come across two key commands: Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage. While they might sound similar, they serve very different purposes, and using the wrong one could lead to unexpected results. Remove-AppxPackage This command removes analready installedapp for a specific user. It\u2019s perfect for cleaning up apps like Xbox or Microsoft.3dBuilder for the current user without affecting others on the same device. However, it won\u2019t stop the app from being installed for new users or those who already have it. Example: This removes the XboxGameOverlay Store app from a specific user\u2019s profile. This removes the XboxGameOverlay Store app from a specific user\u2019s profile. Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage This command goes deeper, removing a provisioned app from theWindows imageitself. In simpler terms, it stops the app from being installed for any new users created on the device. Keep in mind, though, that it doesn\u2019t touch the app for users who already have it installed. Example: This ensures Microsoft Bing Weather won\u2019t be provisioned for any new users on the system. This ensures Microsoft Bing Weather won\u2019t be provisioned for any new users on the system. Key Differences Between the Two When to Use Which Command Use Remove-AppxPackage if you want to clean up apps for a specific user without affecting others. Use Remove-AppxPackage if you want to clean up apps for a specific user without affecting others. Use Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage if you want to stop a preinstalled app from being installed for new users entirely. Use Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage if you want to stop a preinstalled app from being installed for new users entirely. Using PowerShell to Remove Built-In Windows Apps (Safely and Smartly!) We could start crafting our own debloat script, carefully targeting only the problematic built-in Windows apps. But why reinvent the wheel when one of our colleagues at Patch My PC has already done the heavy lifting? Check out this fantastic PowerShell script on GitHub from Ben Whitmore:Remove-Appx-AllUsers.ps1. This script is designed to target and remove only the real unwanted built-in Windows apps for all users without causing collateral damage to critical system functionality. It\u2019s a safe, reliable way to declutter and debloat your devices while avoiding the risks of blindly removing apps or services. If you\u2019re committed to decluttering and debloating, this script is a great starting point, tested, trusted, and ready to use. Just remember to always test scripts in a non-production environment before rolling them out to ensure they align with your deployment goals! The Risks of Reckless Cleanup Scripts Let\u2019s face it: some other cleanup scripts you find online should come with a warning label. It\u2019s not unusual to see PowerShell one-liners that delete every app under the sun, often without checking what they\u2019re removing. Here\u2019s the thing: blindly running these scripts is the IT equivalent of playing Jenga in the dark. You might pull the wrong piece and collapse the entire system. I\u2019ve seen scripts remove components tied to the Start Menu or Search, rendering devices useless. Worse, even seemingly minor removals can create ripple effects that break updates, provisioning, or app functionality. The takeaway? Understand what you\u2019re removing before you act. A Smarter Alternative Option 1: AppLocker and App Control for Business If PowerShell feels risky, it\u2019s because it often is \u2013 especially in production environments. Thankfully, there are smarter alternatives: AppLocker:Block specific apps for users or groups without uninstalling them. This keeps unwanted apps out of sight while preserving system integrity.With Applocker you can define which apps or executables are allowed to execute. If the app is not on the list, it will be blocked. AppLocker:Block specific apps for users or groups without uninstalling them. This keeps unwanted apps out of sight while preserving system integrity.With Applocker you can define which apps or executables are allowed to execute. If the app is not on the list, it will be blocked. App Control for Business /Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC): Take it a step further with policies that prevent users from running specific apps entirely. App Control for Business /Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC): Take it a step further with policies that prevent users from running specific apps entirely. Both solutions give you control without removing anything, which means fewer risks, no broken dependencies, and easy reversals. But that was option 1. Shall we take a look at the built-in option? A Smarter Alternative Option 2: The Uninstall Option Intune has you covered if you\u2019re looking for a smarter, safer way to uninstall Windows Apps without risking a script-induced disaster or the need to implement app control (which we still recommend you do). It\u2019s streamlined and centralized and doesn\u2019t require you to cross your fingers every time you hit \u201cRun.\u201d How It Works: Add the Windows App (New Store App) you want to uninstall to Intune and make sure you Select \u201cSystem Install Behavior\u201d (Sorry but Microsoft Solitaire is not on the list ) to ensure the app is deleted system wide! Add the Windows App (New Store App) you want to uninstall to Intune and make sure you Select \u201dUser Install Behavior\u201d to ensure that if people install the Store App manually, it will also be deleted! With the Apps being added in system and user install behavior, ensure that you assign it foruninstall Deploy the uninstall policy to the right groups to ensure that Windows App will be uninstalled for all users and/or all devices. Add all the new Store Apps individually until they look something like this. Every Windows app below will be uninstalled using a supported approach. Intune takes the guesswork out of app management. It\u2019s repeatable, scalable, and keeps you from sweating over potential mistakes. Plus, with built-in tracking, you can monitor which devices have successfully uninstalled the app, so you no longer have to wonder if your script actually did its job. Please Note:Some apps could be difficult to add. To add them, you need to have the ID: For Example, the Microsoft Tips ID: 9WZDNCRDTBJJ When I need to find the ID, I just search for the app on a specific website. Once found, you can click the MS Store button to go to the MS Store itself. From there, you can find the ID you were desperately looking for. A Smarter Alternative Option 3: The Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages If you\u2019re looking for a Windows built-in way to handle Microsoft Store app cleanup, there\u2019s finally a Group Policy for it. \u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages\u201d lets you remove a curated set of inbox apps natively, no PowerShell scripts, no manual steps. This new feature just landed in the latest Insider builds and is shaping up to be the easiest way to get a cleaner Windows deployment. Want the full technical details and how to enable it?Read the deep dive here. Best Practices for Managing Built-In Windows Apps Whether you\u2019re using PowerShell or policy-based tools, follow these tips to debloat your deployment: Audit First: Run Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers to see what\u2019s installed. Take the time to research each app and understand its function. Test in a Lab: Never deploy removal scripts to production without testing them on non-critical devices first. Use Policies Where Possible: Tools like AppLocker and Appcontrol for Business (WDAC) provide safe ways to manage (block/allow) apps without uninstalling them. Using the Uninstall option in Intune: When you want a safe, repeatable process that integrates smoothly with your Autopilot deployment. Final Thoughts Removing built-in Windows apps during Autopilot can feel like a shortcut to a cleaner deployment\u2014but it can be a slippery slope if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. A single command like Remove-AppxPackage might seem harmless, but the wrong removal can break feature app updates or the provisioning process. Instead of going nuclear, focus on understanding each app\u2019s role in the system. Use tools like AppLocker and WDAC to control apps, or use the built-in uninstall option to get rid of those apps. If you use PowerShell, test everything and make sure you don\u2019t deploy it to production immediately.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/scup-celebration-jan-2024/", "title": "", "raw_text": "System Center Update Publisher: A Celebration of Life \u2013 Jan 31, 2024 Patch lovers everywhere should mark their calendars for a time of mourning on Jan 31, 2024. This will be the day that our dearly beloved System Center Update Publisher, or SCUP as his friends called him, will transition to the great beyond. Some of you might be surprised to hear the old man was still kicking around. After a hip replacement in 2019 (blog), he was still spry and hale, if not a little cantankerous. However, Microsoft has recently moved SCUP into hospice care (docs): While this is an unlooked-for development, it\u2019s not entirely surprising. While SCUP as we know it today was released in 2008, its roots go even further back to SMS 2003\u2019s Custom Updates Publishing Tool (CUPT). Two decades is a good run for any piece of code that isn\u2019t part of an OS kernel or COBOL. For almost all of SCUP\u2019s history, there\u2019s been a call to integrate its functionality directly into the Configuration Manager console. Several years ago, the Configuration Manager product team started this work, and today, you can subscribe and consume an update catalog directly within the console (docs). While catalog consumption wasn\u2019t the only thing our good friend SCUP did, it was by far his most popular feature. The in-console consumption of catalogs corresponded to a change in the catalog format itself. The new v3 catalog allows administrators to subscribe to only specific product categories. Gone are the days when you needed to consume an entire driver catalog and bring SCUP\u2019s best friend, WSUS, to its octogenarian knees. More importantly, the in-console catalog consumption was automatable. Unlike SCUP, administrators could schedule when and how often to sync the catalog and publish the selected products. SCUP\u2019s major failing was that it always requires human interaction to deploy updates. Be aware that in exchange for this automation, you can only publish installers signed with a trusted code signing certificate. This means you can publish an unsigned installer like 7-zip via SCUP, but it will fail when published in-console. What will be forever missed is SCUP\u2019s ability to author your own custom updates for line-of-business apps or modify the updates from a catalog. With the evolution of Configuration Manager\u2019s application model, this became less of a need, but if you adamantly wanted to use the software update model to maintain a consistent user experience, that is no longer possible with the loss of our good friend. What\u2019s an Admin To Do?! Most likely, nothing. First, because you\u2019re probably not using SCUP. If you used it in the past, you have probably moved on to in-console publishing. Second, because SCUP will continue working just fine. Microsoft\u2019s deprecation is merely a support statement, not a statement of functionality. If you plan to continue using SCUP, we highly recommend you grab the latest installer and store it away for safekeeping before it is taken down:https://aka.ms/SCUPDownload. Farewell SCUP! We loved to hate you but will never forget the good times we had together. What\u2019s a Patch My PC Customer To Do? Again, almost certainly nothing. We have averysmall number of customers who purchase a subscription that only supports SCUP publishing. We have reached out to each of those customers to work with them on a way forward that suits their business needs. If they wish to continue using SCUP, we will continue to provide the catalog to do so. If they wish to move to in-console publishing, we will upgrade them to Enterprise Patch for the remainder of their subscriptions free of charge \u2014 simply email[email protected].

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/managed-installer-autopilot-device-preparation-issue/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Autopilot Device Preparation Application Reporting In this blog, I will demonstrate how the Managed Installer (WDAC) policy in Intune can interfere withAutopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) Application reporting, even when the Autopilot Device Preparation enrollment appears successful. 1. Introduction Before exploring the new Autopilot Device Preparation profile, let\u2019s briefly return to the \u201cold\u201d Autopilot and the corresponding Enrollment Status Page. Configuring the blocking apps in theEnrollment Status Page (ESP)Settings would require the device to install those apps for a successful Autopilot Enrollment. This works pretty well in regular Autopilot, especially with the best-effort option that was added, but how does it work with thenew Windows Autopilot device Preparation? With Windows Autopilot Device Preparation, we also have the same option to define the applications that need to be installed during the Autopilot Device Preparation Enrollment. With Autopilot Device Preparation, we could add a maximum of 10 apps to the profile. When those apps are configured as required and assigned to the same just-in-time device group we configured in the profile, we should be good to go, right? I thought so, too! I wiped my virtual machine and restarted the enrollment. After going through the whole flow, the device completed the Autopilot Device Preparation required setup. Still all good, right? Well, I guess not. Let me tell you why! 2. Autopilot Device Preparation Monitor After theWindows Autopilot Device Preparationenrollment required setup finished successfully, I started checking out the installation status in the corresponding Autopilot device Preparation monitor in Intune. Monitoring the deployment status helps troubleshoot a possible enrollment failure and can quickly tell whether the end user had a seamless user experience. I noticed that it mentioned that the deployment status was a success! Again, nothing to worry about, right? So, I clicked on the device enrollment report, and this is what it showed me. All the required apps defined in the policy are now showing as not installed. Okay, that\u2019s definitely weird, as I was expecting this reporting to be near real-time and really accurate. Luckily, I also have access to other tenants, who showed me an accurate status in near real-time. That\u2019s odd. What is happening in my tenant? After waiting a minute or two, the non-installed status switched to the in progress status? That is even more weird. So, I opened the device and clicked on the managed apps. I hoped this managed apps overview would give me a good application installation status. Again\u2026 it mentioned that it was waiting for the install status. So what happened? 3. What Happened My first idea was a stupid idea because I started looking at the Microsoftenrollment status tracking CSPand the corresponding registry to find out what was happening. If you look at the screenshot above, it\u2019s evident that Autopilot Device Preparation is no longer using enrollment status tracking CSP. Since the enrollment status tracking was not showing me anything, I needed to open theCmtracetool and theIntune Management Extension log.After scrolling through the whole Win32app installation process (which seems to be all okay) in the IME log, I started noticing something. After loading the app results and giving me some lovely red errors, it started the content info request. In that request, it also mentioned themanagedinstallerstatus to be 2 Now, I was starting to question myself. I believe this Managed Installer Status should be 1 if we weren\u2019t using the managed installer. Before doing anything else, I needed to know for sure. I opened the Intune Management ExtensionWin32applugin.dlland opened thecontentmanagerv2 Within a few seconds of walking through the code, it showed me what I was looking for! It showed me theManagedInstallerStatuswith a value of 2 and the fact that:the managed installer opt-in is enabled, but the policy has not been set With thatmanagedinstallerstatus set to 2and the managed installer opt-in enabled, it\u2019s evident that somehow the managed installer is enabled in my tenant? 4. The Managed Installer When I noticed the opt-in for the managed installer, I remembered that some time ago, after reading the Patch My PC blog about WDAC, I wanted to test WDAC again, and now with the managed installer from Intune. Windows Defender Application Control/ App Control for Businessis a crucial component in mobile device management (MDM) and plays a significant role in protecting organizational data. If you haven\u2019t read the blog about WDAC, please do, as it will provide you with some valuable insights into configuring WDAC. https://patchmypc.com/wdac-intune I opened the endpoint security blade in Intune and theApp Control for Businesstab. Oh\u2026 well, as shown above, that makes a lot of sense; the managed installer was still enabled. This got me curious, and after spending some time on theWin32AppPlugin code, it was obvious that the app report process also checks if the managed installer feature is enabled. This could explain why my application reporting was broken in the Windows Autopilot Device Preparation Deployment Application Monitor. To be sure. I disabled the managed installer, akaI Opted out.(Opt-in is disabled) After waiting for a few minutes, I reenrolled my device. This time, the reporting was very fast and accurate! We can conclude that if you have themanaged installer enabled in Intune, theAutopilot Device Preparation Application reports will malfunction. The funny thing is that the required setup will also finish successfully, even when the required apps fail to be detected/installed. This is pretty weird if you asked me. If you want to hear and read more about how you could troubleshoot app installation failure during the Autopilot Device Preparation deployment, keep an eye out for some future blogs! 5. Microsoft\u2019s Managed Installer Fix At least after first spotting the error, much work is done to fix the reporting in the back end. Even when the required app fails to install, and the Autopilot device Preparation enrollment thinks it is successful, the Device deployment details will now mention the failed application instead of showing in progress, which is a good improvement! The fix ensures that new devices are accurately reported and administrators can view the deployment status data in real-time. So that\u2019s something, at least. Luckily, Microsoft added this to theknown issues list once Autopilot device Preparation went GA Conclusion for everyone experiencing weird application reporting issues during Windows Autopilot Device Preparation, please ensure youdon\u2019t have the managed installer turned on (Managed Installer Opt-In).If the managed installer is enabled, the application report data will not be accurate, and your device will finish the required setup successfully even with application failure!

What\u2019s Microsoft up to now?If you\u2019re managing devices with Intune, keep an eye on theIntune Management Extension (IME) Client Cert Checker. It\u2019s already making its way into certain tenants, ensuring devices have the right certificates for secure communication. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting: there\u2019s a function calledIsTenantFlightedThat could be part of something bigger. Could it have a role in preventing uninstallation? You\u2019ll need to read the blog to uncover what\u2019s really going on! Introduction Certificates are a key part of device management, keeping communication with Intune secure and making sure everything works as expected. Usually, IT admins don\u2019t have to worry about the Intune certificate since it\u2019s handled automatically. But when managing a large number of devices, things can sometimes go wrong. Certificate issues can lead to failed enrollments or cause devices to lose connection with Intune. In some cases, it might even cause the Intune Management Extension (IME) to get uninstalled unexpectedly. That\u2019s where theIntune Management Extension (IME) Client Cert Checker taskcomes in. This task quietly checks if the correct certificate is in place to ensure everything keeps working as it should. During a recent investigation, I found some interesting details about how this process works behind the scenes and helps maintain smooth communication. The Importance of the MDM Certificate: Let\u2019s start this deep dive by explaining why the Intune MDM certificate is essential to communication with the Intune service. When a device is enrolled in Intune, it receives a client certificate, which acts as its digital identity. This certificate is \u201cwhat authenticates\u201d the device with Intune, ensuring that it\u2019s trusted (more on that later on). With this certificate in place, the device can securely communicate with Intune services, allowing it to receive policies and updates and perform other management tasks. Without a valid MDM certificate, a device would be cut off from Intune and unable to receive application updates. This could lead to significant security risks, especially in environments where device compliance is critical to the overall security posture. Given the stakes, ensuring that the correct MDM client certificate is in place and valid at all times is paramount. This is where the Intune Management Extension comes into play, working behind the scenes to pick and validate these certificates. IME Client Cert Checker: The new shiny Intune Management Extension Client Cert Checker scheduled task is a key component in this process. This new scheduled task runs regularly to check whether the device has a valid MDM client certificate. When first looking at this new task, it seems designed to prevent scenarios in which a device might lose its ability to communicate with Intune due to an invalid or missing certificate. Let\u2019s start with a simple overview of how this Intune Management Extension Client Cert Checker scheduled task works in 6 steps. From there on, we will zoom in on each step of this process to learn more. Client Cert Checker Initiation Certificate Search Tenant Flight Check Certificate Validation Metadata Storage Leveraging CertMetadata Let\u2019s break down the core steps the Client Cert Checker follows to ensure certificates remain valid. 1. Client Cert Checker Initiation Registry Check: The process begins by checking the registry for the last time the certificate metadata was updated. If a valid certificate is found and stored within the last 24 hours, the task is skipped. 2. Certificate Search: Store Scanning:The Client Cert Checker searches the device\u2019s LocalMachine\\My and CurrentUser\\My certificate stores for any certificates that match theOID 1.2.840.113556.5.6. ThisOIDspecifically identifies MDM client certificates, making it easier to narrow down the search. We can do the same with PowerShell and trying to find the certificates that have that specific OID set Filtering:During the search, the task also filters out certificates that do not have a private key or are expired. Filtering:During the search, the task also filters out certificates that do not have a private key or are expired. After these checks are done, and if only one or no certificates are found, the task stops, and the certificate metadata in the registry is deleted. This means that theClient Cert Checker/Picker taskhas found either no certificates or only one valid certificate in the device\u2019s certificate store, and as a result, it is not proceeding with further certificate validation or selection. Suppose more than one valid certificate is found. In that case, the Client Cert Checker will proceed to further validation steps, such as Intune Tenant flighting, to determine the most appropriate certificate to use. 3. Tenant Flighting Check Flighted Tenants:If multiple certificates are found, the task identifies the certificate by searching for the OID we noticed in Step 2 From there on, it checks whether the tenant is \u201cflighted.\u201d Tenant flighting ensures that only certificates from authorized tenants are allowed to proceed. From there on, it checks whether the tenant is \u201cflighted.\u201d Tenant flighting ensures that only certificates from authorized tenants are allowed to proceed. Non-Flighted Tenants:If the \u201ctenant\u201d is NOT flighted, the process is halted, the certificates are not used, and any existing certificate metadata in the registry is deleted. Non-Flighted Tenants:If the \u201ctenant\u201d is NOT flighted, the process is halted, the certificates are not used, and any existing certificate metadata in the registry is deleted. TenantIDis not flighted. That\u2019s interesting! Let\u2019s take a quick detour to discover what this tenant ID is. To do so, we need to spend some time on the account ID. While writing this blog, I started asking myself the same question over and over: What is this Account ID corresponding with theOID 1.2.840.113556.5.6 value of the Intune MDM Device CA Certificate? Please Note: If you want to know more about the other OIDs, please check out this blog:Unpacking the Microsoft Intune MDM Certificate \u2013 MSEndpointMgr With the account ID decrypted, it became much easier to determine its function\u2026Well, that may be because I was also looking at some code from the Endpoint Privilege Management client. As shown below,IntuneInfo RetrieveIntuneInformation. I\u2019m just thinking out loud here, but\u2026 we got theAAD/Entra Tenant IDand this Account ID / OID, which is the Intune Information. Could this Account ID be theMSFT Internal Intune Tenant ID? I think it is!! Let me explain a bit more. Inside the WindowsAgent code, we could spot the clientcertpickerflighting method and how this method determines if the tenant is \u201cflighted\u201d. It does so by taking a look at a hardcoded list of GUIDS. For everyone who is wondering.. Yes I tried to find out to which tenants these GUIDs belong. When using AADInternalsOSINTtool to obtain the tenant information, this is what we got! No Information was found. Entering my own test tenant Entra ID showed me all the information. One thing is for sure: those GUIDS are not ENTRA tenants but belong to some specific Intune Tenants. Let\u2019s abandon this Account ID side quest and proceed to the certificate validation. 4. Certificate Validation via SideCarGatewaySession Remote Validation:For certificates from flighted tenants, the Client Cert Checker task initiates aSideCarGatewaySessionwith the Intune service to validate the certificates. This session sends certificate details to the service, which checks their validity and ensures they are correctly issued. Handling Results:If a valid client certificate is found during this session, it is selected for use. The certificate\u2019s metadata, including its subject name, thumbprint, and validation time, is then stored in the registry under CertMetadata. This allows for quick future validation. 5. Metadata Storage and Future Efficiency Registry Storage:The validated certificate\u2019s details are stored in the registry. This enables the IME to quickly validate the certificate in future operations without needing to redo the entire validation process. Fallback Mechanism:If no valid client certificate is found during the SideCarGatewaySession, or if the tenant is not flighted, the task deletes any existing certificate metadata, ensuring that only valid and current certificates are used. 6. Leveraging CertMetadata: Now that a valid certificate and its metadata are stored in the registry, the IME can use this information for future operations. When the IME needs to re-establish communication with Intune (such as during policy refreshes or device check-ins), it doesn\u2019t need to start from scratch. Instead, it checks the CertMetadata first: Quick Validation:If the stored metadata matches a certificate found in the certificate store, the IME can quickly validate the certificate without contacting the Intune service again. This significantly reduces the time needed to validate the certificate, allowing the device to re-establish communication more efficiently. Quick Validation:If the stored metadata matches a certificate found in the certificate store, the IME can quickly validate the certificate without contacting the Intune service again. This significantly reduces the time needed to validate the certificate, allowing the device to re-establish communication more efficiently. Fallback Mechanism:However, if the metadata is outdated or the certificate is no longer valid, the IME has a fallback mechanism in place. It will search the certificate stores again using the OID and select the most appropriate certificate based on criteria like expiration date and the presence of a private key. Fallback Mechanism:However, if the metadata is outdated or the certificate is no longer valid, the IME has a fallback mechanism in place. It will search the certificate stores again using the OID and select the most appropriate certificate based on criteria like expiration date and the presence of a private key. This approach ensures that the device can always find and use a valid certificate, even if the cert metadata is missing. The Graphical Flow Text can be text. Let me show the flow so it makes sense for those who didn\u2019t want to read the full story above. Under the hood of the Client Cert Checker: GetMDMCert, and GetDeviceCertificate Let\u2019s dive in a bit more into some of the Client Cert Checker methods and functions. The first one is the GetMDMCert Method. The GetMDMCert method within the AgentInfoRetriever class handles the heavy lifting of certificate retrieval. This method plays a crucial role in the IME\u2019s ability to communicate securely with Intune services. Using Metadata for Efficiency:The GetMDMCert method first checks the registry\u2019s CertMetadata to find a matching certificate. If a valid certificate is found using the metadata, this certificate is selected for use, ensuring an efficient process. Using Metadata for Efficiency:The GetMDMCert method first checks the registry\u2019s CertMetadata to find a matching certificate. If a valid certificate is found using the metadata, this certificate is selected for use, ensuring an efficient process. Fallback Search:If no valid certificate is found using metadata, or if the tenant is not flighted, the method falls back to searching the LocalMachine\\My and CurrentUser\\My stores directly. It looks for certificates with the correct OID and selects the most appropriate one, ensuring that the device is never left without a valid MDM certificate. Fallback Search:If no valid certificate is found using metadata, or if the tenant is not flighted, the method falls back to searching the LocalMachine\\My and CurrentUser\\My stores directly. It looks for certificates with the correct OID and selects the most appropriate one, ensuring that the device is never left without a valid MDM certificate. This method is then called by the GetDeviceCertificate function in the DiscoveryService class. This function ensures that the device has a valid certificate before attempting to communicate with Intune services. Ensuring Communication Readiness:The GetDeviceCertificate method checks if the device already has a valid certificate cached. If not, or if the certificate is older than a day, it retrieves a new one using GetMDMCert. This ensures that the device is always ready to securely communicate with Intune. Ensuring Communication Readiness:The GetDeviceCertificate method checks if the device already has a valid certificate cached. If not, or if the certificate is older than a day, it retrieves a new one using GetMDMCert. This ensures that the device is always ready to securely communicate with Intune. Configuring Service Endpoints:Once a valid certificate is obtained, the DiscoveryService uses it to discover service endpoints and configure the environment for communication with Intune. This includes setting up the SideCarGatewayService, which is crucial for ongoing interactions with Intune. Configuring Service Endpoints:Once a valid certificate is obtained, the DiscoveryService uses it to discover service endpoints and configure the environment for communication with Intune. This includes setting up the SideCarGatewayService, which is crucial for ongoing interactions with Intune. Key Takeaways: Certificate validation is crucial: Without a valid MDM client certificate, a device could lose its ability to communicate with Intune, impacting policy delivery, updates, and overall security. Client Cert Checker in action: This scheduled task makes sure that the right certificates are always in place, verifying certs regularly to keep the device connected and compliant with Intune. Automation at its best: The Client Cert Checker automates the entire certificate validation process\u2014from searching for certificates to checking tenant flighting\u2014so IT admins don\u2019t have to worry about manual oversight or unexpected issues. What\u2019s Next? While spending time on the Client Cert Check, I seem to also have stumbled upon something else as well. The ClientCertPickingFlighting.IsCurrentTenantFlighted function is also being used in a different function as well. Did you read what it says above? SKipping the uninstallation as the tenant is flighted to NOT uninstall\u201d That really sounds like some additional protection in some rare cases when the IME gets uninstalled out of a sudden. Stay tuned for a deep dive on that topic as well! Conclusion The IMEClientCertPickertask ensures your device always has the right cert for secure communication with Intune. It checks for valid certs, logs the results, and updates the registry if everything\u2019s good. If not, it clears out any stale entries. In short: it\u2019s a safety net, making sure your device is always packing the right cert for secure Intune communication. If it\u2019s got one, awesome, if not, it makes sure there\u2019s nothing hanging around that shouldn\u2019t be. Just likePatch My PC,which ensures your apps are always up to date and secure, the Client Cert Checker ensures the right certificates are in place, ensuring the IME can\u2019t be uninstalled without proper authorization.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-subscription-activation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Mission: (Im)Possible \u2013 Windows Subscription Activation Are you curious how Microsoft plans to fix the Windows subscription activation issue? Patch My PC was, too! We examined the latest Windows Insider preview and the June/July Windows Updates and noticed some improvements. If you want to know more, keep on reading! The Subscription Activation Issue If you\u2019re encountering issues with the automatic license upgrade from Windows Pro to Windows Enterprise, particularly after installing the latestWindows 11 update KB5036980,you are at the correct address! In aprevious blog, Rudy explained how theKB5036980Windows update has caused subscription activation issues, preventing devices from upgrading their license from Windows Pro to Windows Enterprise. This issue also causes existing devices to drop from Windows Enterprise to Windows Pro, which could cause some serious security issues! All the security policies that only work with Windows Enterprise will stop working when the license is reverted to Windows Pro. In that blog, he identified a scheduled \u201clicense acquisition\u201d task responsible for the subscription activation issues. This license acquisition task failed because it failed to create theMFA Required in ClipRenewregistry key, blocking the upgrade process. This issue could be easily fixed by creating those registry keys yourself! As shown below, Microsoft is aware of the subscription activation issue and is actively working on a solution. When a fix is in the works, it\u2019s usually released to the Windows Insider canary channel first. The same happened with the subscription activation issue. Microsoft added a new feature in theWindows insider preview build 26227.5000 Windows Insider Preview 26227.5000 With the Windows Insider Build 26227.5000, Microsoft attempted to fix the access denied error that could occur when the license acquisition task is launched to upgrade your Windows License. We noticed something funny when looking at the added features in this insider canary release. Microsoft added a nice new feature calledMFACheckingClipRenew_HandleAccessDenied. By the looks of it, Microsoft will address the \u201cAccess Denied\u201dmessage we encountered when attempting to add the MFA-required registry key. After noticing that this feature was added to the Windows Insider Preview, we installed the 26227.5000 Canary build to see if it would resolve the issue. I executed the scheduled license task post-installation but found that it still resulted in the\u201cAccess is denied\u201d (0x80070005)error. What is going on? I was really expecting the handleAccessDenied feature to start handling the Access denied message. The cliprenew.exe is responsible for the subscription upgrade, so I decided to peek at its code. The Updated ClipRenew After opening the ClipRenew executable with the IDA tool, we noticed that the main code had an additional feature. The code now holds an additional feature calledMFACheckinCliprenew_HandleAccessDenied. It sounds as if Microsoft added a feature tohandle the access denied error. In addition to this new feature, which will handle the access denied error, we also spotted an additional feature in the code that checks if that access denied feature is enabled. Inside the handle access denied feature, it also checks if theUxSettingTestfeature is enabled. After spotting these features, I downloaded the VIVE tool and manually enabled the Windows features. UxSettingTest: 48433706 MFACheckInClipRenew_HandleAccessDenied: 49577403 Enabling only one of them will still result in the scheduled task failing, so you will need to enable both! After enabling them and rebooting my device, I almost began to cheer! (well, almost) As shown above, the license acquisition task was completed successfully, and I no longer received an access denied error! Great! Well, almost. With the access denied error gone, I decided to open the registry to check out theMFA-required registry key. Exactly \u2026. The MFA-required registry key was still not created!!! Let\u2019s add Procmon to it to find out what is happening, as I expected theMfaRequiredInClipRenewkey to be created with this handle access denied feature. As shown above, ClipRenew tries to create themfarequiredincliprenewregistry key, but it fails. It will retry again, but it will fail again. This time, it doesn\u2019t error out but continues doing its job. It seems like ClipRenew is now handling theaccess denied error. How does that work? Handle Access Denied Let\u2019s examine howClipRenewhandles this access denied error. I started by opening the Procmon trace and comparing it with the ClipRenew code. Both Procmon and the ClipRenew code seem to tell me the same thing. IfHandleAccessDenied is enabled,the code attempts to create or open the MFA required registry key and set its value. IfHandleAccessDenied is not enabled, the code still tries to create or open the registry key and set its value but uses adifferent approach. Thisdifferent approachseems to be a graceful exit because the moment Procmon tells me that ClipRenew isn\u2019t allowed to create the registry keys, it contactslicensing.mp.microsoft.comto discuss the subscription activation status. This is way more than it was doing at first, but still without the MFA required created. It looks like thisfeature to handle access denied was just the first step to fixing the MFA-required access denied issue. Let\u2019s move on, shall we? I was curious if the latest preview update of June was taking a different approach. June KB5039302 This part of the blog can be pretty short: Yes!!! Microsoft added the same \u201d workaround\u201d from the insider canary build into the June Preview update. When we enable the same two features with the Vive tool, the scheduled task can be executed successfully! As shown above, the scheduled task could be run successfully with the two features enabled! However, the \u201creal fix\u201d for creating and handling the MFA required key is still missing and hasn\u2019t been addressed yet. Hopefully, we will see a solution in a future Windows update. July KB5040442 With the July Patch Tuesday, I was wondering if thisKB5040442will hold the actual fix. After I updated my device with the 2024-07 July update, I was curious if the LicenceAcquisition would show me that it completed successfully. As shown above, I guess not! I decided to compare the Cliprenew.exe code from the July build with the previous Cliprenew.exe from the June OOB update. Comparing them showed me that there were not that many changes! I guess we all know what that means! The July KB5040442 Update is not going to fix your subscription activation issues! Hopefully, the August update will. In the meantime, we still need to manually create the MfaRequired registry keys and change the permissions to fix it ourselves. Or\u2026.. The ViveTool Fix With the possibility to enable the features with the Vivetool, we could also enable those two features on our own UxSettingTest: 48433706andMFACheckInClipRenew_HandleAccessDenied: 49577403 With the PowerShell script below, we will download the ViveTool, enable the 2 features, query if they are enabled, and clean up afterward. Please make sure that you reboot your device afterward! July Preview Update KB5040527 With the June update, Microsoft added the Handle_access_denied feature in clip-renew to ensure the licence acquisition scheduled task won\u2019t error out. This feature wasn\u2019t enabled in the June update. With the release of the July KB5040527 update, Microsoft enabled the feature in Windows. With this feature now enabled by default, the handle_access_denied feature is going to take care of the errors and ignores the outcome. For now this is the fix we all have been waiting for!!! Somehow, it doesn\u2019t feel like the ultimate fix. With this handle_access_denied feature, the MFARequiredincliprenew registry key has still not been created. This was the reason why we started having issues with the April build. I am going to assume that another update is coming our way to also deal with this registry key. If we spot it, we will update this blog! Conclusion You\u2019re not alone if you\u2019ve faced subscription activation issues upgrading from Windows 11 Pro to Enterprise due to update KB5036980. Microsoft is aware of this and is working on a fix. Unfortunately, the June update (KB5039302) and the July update (KB5040442) did not resolve the issue despite including the handle access denied feature. Hopefully, future updates will adequately address the access denied issue.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/cve-security-navigation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Navigating the Galaxy of CVE Security Issues It\u2019s evident that CVEs represent critical entry points for cyberattacks, posing substantial risks to organizational integrity. Organizations are lacking in this war against cyber-attacks. Our internal industry expert, Trevor Thompson, recently met with a relevant Chief Security Officer to better understand this war and how to combat it head on before it becomes a detrimental issue to your organization. Before sharing his thoughts, it\u2019s important to clarify what we\u2019re referring to, when we mention CVE\u2019s and their importance for organizations as a whole. What is a CVE? A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a unique identifier for a specific security vulnerability. It provides a standardized format for tracking and managing vulnerabilities across systems and organizations, aiding in vulnerability assessment, patch management, and risk prioritization. CVEs are essential for effective communication, collaboration, and mitigation efforts in cybersecurity, helping security professionals identify, prioritize, and address security threats efficiently. How does the CVE system work? The CVE system ensures standardized vulnerability management practices, facilitating efficient coordination and response to security threats. The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system operates through a coordinated process managed by authorized organizations called CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). When a security vulnerability is discovered, a CNA assigns it a unique CVE identifier, which is then publicly disclosed in the CVE List along with relevant details about the vulnerability. This identifier serves as a common reference point for communication, collaboration, and tracking of vulnerabilities across the cybersecurity community. Why should I care? Organizations need to be prepared against potential security threats and vulnerabilities. Professionals across the security industry are alert to hear of the newest updates. Due to their ever-evolving nature, many professionals still struggle with protective measures. We\u2019ve interviewed a CSO to understand more of these struggles, with suggestions on where organizations can turn for help. Dinner Discourse with a Chief Security Officer: The Constant Struggle to Stay Ahead of CVE\u2019s I recently had dinner with a good friend \u2013 we\u2019ll call him Malachi to obscure his identity. Malachi has been in the security professionals industry for over a decade, most recently as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of a large industrial products company. He\u2019s worked hard to get to where he is in his career. I work for a security software company that provides 3rd party patching solutions. We were both recently sharing stories over dinner about work and got immersed in a conversation that focused on a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, also known as CVEs. As a seasoned professional in the realm of digital defense, Malachi spoke candidly about the immense pressures he\u2019s been under lately, how Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures were consuming his professional life, and the challenges his security teams were facing in addressing them promptly. Being in IT for decades and having a background in Telecomm I\u2019ve learned to remember a few acronyms, but this was one I\u2019d not heard in a long time so Malichi helped me understand a little better. Sitting up in his seat, Malachi stated \u201cTo grasp the significance of CVEs you have to understand what they entail.\u201d He continued to tell me that a CVE is essentially any publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities or particularly vulnerable security flaws, each assigned a unique CVE identifier number or CVE Record. These critical vulnerabilities serve as potential entry points for cyberattacks, posing significant risks to organizations\u2019 digital infrastructure and data integrity. They represent vulnerabilities that, if left unaddressed, could lead to catastrophic consequences.\u201d Confirming that I understood him, I responded with a pop culture reference analogy: \u201cCVEs are like the exhaust ports on the Death Star in Star Wars!\u201d In the iconic film, the exhaust port presented a critical vulnerability that, when exploited by Luke Skywalker\u2019s precise torpedo strike, resulted in the destruction of the Emperor\u2019s formidable space station. Similarly, in the realm of sophisticated cyber attacks, organizations often face particular vulnerabilities within their systems and networks that, if exploited by malicious actors, can lead to data breaches, system compromises, and other devastating outcomes. Malachi smiled. He liked my Exhaust Port/CVE analogy, and he\u2019d heard his company referred to as the \u2018Evil Empire\u2019 before. This time, though, he likened his company\u2019s digital infrastructure to the Death Star, emphasizing the need for proactive identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities and cyber attacks before they can be exploited by \u201cRebel Scum.\u201d He expressed concerns about the timeliness of his security experts\u2019 awareness of and response to CVEs, highlighting the need for a solution that provides prompt notification of emerging vulnerabilities and tracks the status of patching efforts to mitigate the CVE. In the midst of our conversation about Software Patching, CVEs, and Star Wars Malachi articulated his desire for tools that could effectively address his company\u2019s CVE-related challenges. Such a tool would ideally provide comprehensive insights into the CVE landscape, including which vulnerabilities directly impact the organization, their severity levels, and the current status of patching efforts. By having this information readily available he and his security team could prioritize their efforts, allocate resources efficiently, and mitigate potential risks effectively. As I reflected on our discussion, it became evident that CVEs represent more than just a list of security flaws- they serve as a call to action for organizations to fortify their defenses and safeguard their digital assets. Just as Luke Skywalker\u2019s decisive actions thwarted the Empire\u2019s plans in Star Wars, proactive identification and mitigation of CVEs can neutralize the looming threats posed by cyber adversaries, the real villains in our galaxy. So what tools do currently (or should) exist to help CSOs like Malachi rest from the worries of unattended CVEs? 4 CVE Security Tools Advancing Protection for Organizations There are several cybersecurity organizations, security companies and vendors, vendor advisories, bug bounty service providers, tools, and solutions available to help organizations identify and mitigate CVEs effectively. These tools vary in their capabilities, ranging from vulnerability scanners to comprehensive vulnerability management platforms. Additionally, reporting on the proper mitigation of CVEs often involves tracking patching efforts, monitoring a particular vulnerability over time, and ensuring compliance with security standards. Here are some common solutions and approaches on the market for identifying CVEs and reporting on their mitigation: Organizations can subscribe to CVE database and feeds such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or commercial feeds provided by vendors like VulnDB. These infrastructure security agency resources and security advisories have a common vulnerability scoring system and provide up-to-date information on CVEs including descriptions, the security vulnerability, severity ratings, and references to affected software and systems. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Platforms: SOAR platforms integrate various security tools and processes to automate incident response workflows, including CVE identification and mitigation. These platforms can streamline the remediation of CVEs by orchestrating patching processes, triggering automated responses to detected vulnerabilities, and generating reports on mitigation efforts. A prominent nonprofit organization, the Mitre Corporation plays a pivotal role in cybersecurity through its CVE program. CVE, managed by Mitre, serves as a standardized system for identifying and catalogingcybersecurity vulnerabilitiesacross various software systems and platforms. Each CVE entry is assigned a CVE ID helping to facilitate communication and collaboration among security professionals, researchers, and vendors. Mitre collaborates with government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to bolster national cybersecurity efforts. Mitre\u2019s CVE program participants, including security researchers, vendors, and bug bounty service providers, contribute to the identification and resolution of security issues across various computer systems and operating systems. Reporting on the proper mitigation of CVEs involves tracking the status of identified vulnerabilities and verifying that appropriate remediation measures have been implemented. This may include documenting patching activities, verifying the installation of security updates, and conducting periodic vulnerability scans to ensure that CVEs have been effectively addressed. Patch management systemsplay a critical role in cybersecurity by facilitating the deployment of software updates and patches to mitigate security vulnerabilities, including those identified through Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers. These systems, such as Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) or Intune, and Patch My PC, enable organizations to address known vulnerabilities efficiently. Patch management systems utilize CVE IDs to identify which patches need to be applied to mitigate specific security flaws and ensure the security of computer systems and sensitive data. CVE identifiers (CVE IDs) are unique labels assigned to publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to track and prioritize remediation efforts effectively. By integrating reporting capabilities, patch management systems enable organizations to track the status of patch deployment and demonstrate compliance with security policies and regulations. This reporting functionality assists in measuring the effectiveness of mitigation efforts over time and prioritizing remediation efforts for critical vulnerabilities. AtPatch My PCwe are developing a vulnerability management solution that enhances these capabilities by offering built-in reporting features specifically tailored to track CVEs. This solution will enable organizations to monitor and manage vulnerabilities more effectively, ensuring the security of their systems against sophisticated cyber-attacks and demonstrating compliance with security standards. In conclusion, patch management systems are essential tools for cybersecurity professionals and organizations, helping them address security vulnerabilities promptly and maintain a robust security posture in the face of evolving cyber threats. Conclusion The dinner conversation with Malachi the CSO offered valuable insights into the intricate world of CVEs and their impact on organizational security. It underscored the importance of proactive vulnerability management and the need for innovative solutions to address the evolving threat landscape of cyber-attack complexity effectively.

However, on non-en-US devices, it can trigger the\u201cFailed to Find MUI File\u201derror, locking you out completely. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the issue, its cause, and how to fix it. Introduction WithAdministrator Protectionjust being released to theInsider Preview Windows Builds,it\u2019s clear that Microsoft is stepping up its game in securing local admin accounts. The Local Administrator Protection feature promises to lock down admin tokens and prevent abuse, making it a powerful addition to the Windows security toolkit. But, as with any new feature, it could have some funny issues. We discovered a critical issue during testing when enabling Local Administrator Protection on devices configured withNONen-USlanguages likeen-GB. Instead of improving security, it ended up completely locking us out of local administrator accounts! Let\u2019s dive into what caused the Failed to Find MUI File error, how we fixed it, and why you need to tread carefully before enabling this feature in your environment. The MUI Errors: What Happened After Enabling It? Let\u2019s take a look at what happened before diving in! After enablingLocal Administrator Protectionand rebooting, the device refused to let us log in with a local administrator account. Instead, we were greeted with weird cryptic errors like: The resource loader cache doesn\u2019t have loaded MUI entry. The resource loader cache doesn\u2019t have loaded MUI entry. The resource loader failed to find MUI file. The resource loader failed to find MUI file. These errors aren\u2019t just annoying; they completely block access to local admin accounts, leaving you in a funny situation (well, it depends on what you think is funny). But what\u2019s behind these errors? That\u2019s whereProcMoncame in handy. The Root Cause: Missing MUI Files To troubleshoot, we ranProcMonthrough an RMM tool in the system context (as we couldn\u2019t log in to the device anymore, right?) and found the culprit: the missing MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files. As shown below, the moment we tried to elevate something from the non-admin account, consent.exe showed that it couldn\u2019t find the MUI file. Local Administrator Protectionseems to rely on these files to handle certain system resources, but if they\u2019re missing from your device\u2019s language configuration, the feature seems to break. Here\u2019s what we uncovered: File Not Found:The system repeatedly tried to access files like consent.exe.mui and samsrv.dll.mui in the System32/en-GB folder. File Not Found:The system repeatedly tried to access files like consent.exe.mui and samsrv.dll.mui in the System32/en-GB folder. MUI Exists for en-US Only:These filesDO existin theen-USdirectory but were missing foren-GBand likely other non-en-USWindows Builds. MUI Exists for en-US Only:These filesDO existin theen-USdirectory but were missing foren-GBand likely other non-en-USWindows Builds. This mismatch seems to indicate that devices configured with non-en-USlanguages couldn\u2019t handle certain operations required by Local Administrator Protection, resulting in the MUI error and the corresponding login failures. The Simple Fix: Adding en-US Language To resolve the issue, here\u2019s what worked for us: Install the en-US Language Pack:AddEnglish (United States)as a display language via Settings > Time & Language > Language & Region. Be sure to set it as your Windows display language. AddEnglish (United States)as a display language via Settings > Time & Language > Language & Region. Be sure to set it as your Windows display language. Update Administrative Language Settings: In the Control Panel, navigate to Region > Administrative and set theSystem LocaletoEnglish (United States)for non-Unicode programs. Ensure that you copy the Language settings to new users and the welcome screen and SYSTEM ACCOUNTS Reboot and Re-enable the Feature:After making these changes, reboot the device, re-enable Local Administrator Protection After enabling local administrator protection and rebooting the device, we were able to login! Lessons Learned: Test Before You Deploy Here\u2019s what this experience taught us: Test Non-en-US Configurations:Devices configured with non-en-US languages (likeen-GB,de-DE, etc.) are likely to run into this issue. Always test thoroughly before enabling Local Administrator Protection across your environment. Check for MUI Files:Missing MUI files for your device\u2019s language configuration can break the feature. Addingen-USas a fallback is the easiest solution for now. Plan for Localization Issues:Remember, Local Administrator Protection is still in preview. Localization bugs like this will get fixed in future updates, but for now, be ready with workarounds. Microsoft Fixed it! Microsoft has implemented a fix for theMUI file errorinAdministrator Protectionwith Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 27802. In aprevious administrator protection blog,we highlighted howAdministrator Protectionuses aseparate hidden admin accountfor elevation instead of elevating the logged-in user directly. Itseemsthat this separate account had trouble loading the correct language files. Instead of using the standard Windows method, it looked for specific language versions on its own, causing errors when those files weren\u2019t available. With this update, enabling Administrator Protection should no longer result in aresource loader cache errorat sign-in. Announcing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 27802 (Canary Channel) | Windows Insider Blog Wrapping It Up Local Administrator Protection is a great step forward for securing local admin accounts, but it\u2019s clear that it still has some rough edges. Especially for devices running non-en-US configurations. If you plan to enable this feature, ensure you enable it on EN-US Windows Builds and always test in a lab before deploying.

This would lead to this update being applicable on devices where the update was not installed. Determine if You are Affected Customers may be affected by this issue if all of the following are true: The product Poedit (EXE) is selected and synced as a WSUS Update in the Patch My PC Publisher, SCUP or ConfigMgr In-Console updatesThis issue does not affect ConfigMgr Apps in the Publisher or Intune Apps or Updates from the Publisher or Cloud This issue does not affect ConfigMgr Apps in the Publisher or Intune Apps or Updates from the Publisher or Cloud A sync occured between Sept 11, 2024 at 10:01AM PST and Sept 12, 2024 at 6:25AM PST The Poedit (EXE) update was deployed to endpoints Customers where all of the the above are true may have found that the Poedit application installed on targeted systems where the Operating System was Windows 10 or later, this includes server OSes where the major OS version is 10 or greater. Patch My PC estimates that this issue affects less than 1% of our customers based on the telemetry available and will contact potentially affected customers directly in the coming weeks. Enhance/Improve validation processes within the engineering team for all rule changes related to existing updates.Issue Outline On Sept. 11, 2024 at 2:20AM PST the Patch My PC catalog team was made aware of a change to the Poedit application where the application now required Windows 10 or greater. The team modified the existing update, and Patch My PC published this update on Sept. 11 at 10:01AM PST. The update passed Patch My PCs tests, as it installed properly on the test device. On Sept 12, 2024 at 3:08AM PST, a customer contacted Patch My PC Support stating that the update for Poedit was installing on devices where Poedit did not previously exist. The Patch My PC support team identified the issue and alerted the Catalog Team at 3:55AM PST. At this time Patch My PC found that the Operating System rule that was added was mistakenly added within an OR condition instead of an AND condition. This made the update applicable on any devices with an Operating System of Windows 10 or later. The Catalog Team then fixed and tested the new rules. On Sept. 12, 2024 at 6:25AM PST, Patch My PC published the fixed rules to the catalog. Any customers that had synced with the incorrect rules after this time will get the new fixed rules on their next sync. Looking forward After this issue, Patch My PC is making the following changes: Improve the validation processes within the engineering team for all rule changes related to existing updates Add additional testing to flag overly generic applicability rules before they are published Improve telemetry so that Patch My PC can contact customers directly if there are issues with specific products or updates in the catalog Cleanup Remediation for this issue consists of uninstalling the software from affected endpoints. There are multiple methods to perform this uninstallation. Uninstall Script Patch My PC has a generalized uninstalltion script that can be used to remediate this issue.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/how-use-app-control-business/", "title": "", "raw_text": "How to Use App Control for Business (WDAC) to Secure Your Devices App Control for Business, the new name forWindows Defender Application Control (WDAC), is a security feature that lets you block unauthorized and harmful software from running on your devices. More importantly, it also comes with a new managed installer for Intune. By combining this managed installer with Patch My PC or Scappman, you can effortlessly keep your software up to date while maintaining complete control over what is permitted to run within your environment. Your software will always be up to date while restricting application usage, preventing malware, and blocking side processes and malware, all at the same time! In fact, patching and Windows Defender Application Control is included in CISA\u2019s #StopRansomware Guide and the Australian Essential Eight signals directorate. Overall, it\u2019s clear that joining both technologies is a dream come true for those who are security conscious. In order to show you how this works, in this blog, we will: Enable Managed Installer in App control for Business. Create a WDAC Base Policy. Enable App Control for Business Base policy. Create a supplemental policy for Patch My PC with PowerShell. Create a supplemental policy for Scappman with WDAC Wizard. We will also use script enforcement in our WDAC base policy (Note: WDAC is a standard Windows component included on Windows 10, 11, and Windows Server 2016). This will help stop \u201cliving off the land attacks\u201d based on PowerShell and improve your attack surface reduction policy. Step 1: Enable Managed Installer The Managed Installer Applocker policy makes the Intune Management Extension an authorized source for installing applications. When the Intune Management Extension (IME) executes the application install, Windows actively observes the process and any subsequent processes it spawns. Applocker pays close attention to any files created on the disk during this operation. As these files are written, they are labeled to indicate their origin as coming from a managed installer and tagged by the managed installer. Each application marked by the managed installer will then be permitted to execute. Enabling this option will deploy an AppLocker policy to all devices. In case you missed that, let me repeat thatenabling this policy in Intune will enable this tenant widefor all devices. Note: If you don\u2019t want to deploy to all devices, please read the extra note at the bottom of this section. A few minutes after enabling, you will observe the following: The Managed Installer Applocker policy deployment happens with a hidden pro-active remediation script. You can find the PowerShell code inC:\\Windows\\IMECache\\HealthScripts That proactive remediation script will place aManagedInstaller.AppLockerfile inC:\\Windows\\System32\\AppLocker Now, that extra note I was talking about earlier: If you want to test without enabling the managed installer tenant-wide, you can manually run that script and choose not to enable the managed installer option in your Intune portal. I have uploaded those scripts to my Github page here:https://github.com/vincentverstraeten/ManagedInstaller/ Step 2: Create a WDAC Intune Base Policy Additionally, the managed installer needs a WDAC policy to work, so we\u2019ll start by creating a WDAC base policy. The easiest way to generate a new WDAC base policy is to use the WDAC Policy Wizard, which helps you generate the XML data you need for your application control policy. You can download the WDAC Policy Wizardhere. Alternatively, you can find example policies to start with in every Windows installation under this folder:%windir%schemasCodeIntegrityExamplePolicies This guide will focus on the easiest way to deploy WDAC rules. Select theMultiple Policy Formatand opt for theBase policy(Note: We\u2019re choosing the Multiple Policy Format because we plan to incorporate a supplemental policy later to designate Patch My PC and Scappman as trusted publishers). Then click Next. Select theMultiple Policy Formatand opt for theBase policy(Note: We\u2019re choosing the Multiple Policy Format because we plan to incorporate a supplemental policy later to designate Patch My PC and Scappman as trusted publishers). Then click Next. In the Configure Policy Template section, we will: In the Configure Policy Template section, we will: Enable Managed Installer Enable Managed Installer Set Audit Mode (since I am running this in a non-production environment, I am settingAudit Modetooff.) Set Audit Mode (since I am running this in a non-production environment, I am settingAudit Modetooff.) Click Next. Click Next. The WDAC Policy Wizard will then propose a set of Microsoft trusted Publisher rules. We won\u2019t change anything here, so click Next. The WDAC Policy Wizard will then propose a set of Microsoft trusted Publisher rules. We won\u2019t change anything here, so click Next. Then you\u2019re done! You just created your first WDAC base policy. Then you\u2019re done! You just created your first WDAC base policy. Step 3: Configure Windows App Control for Business (Preview) Create a device configuration in the Endpoint security Intune blade. Go to Endpoint portal -> Endpoint security -> App Control for Business -> Create Policy Go to Endpoint portal -> Endpoint security -> App Control for Business -> Create Policy Name your App Control For Business Configuration setting. Name your App Control For Business Configuration setting. Select Enter xml data and select your Base policy created .XML file. Select Enter xml data and select your Base policy created .XML file. Create and assign a Security group with a device in it. Create and assign a Security group with a device in it. You now have a WDAC Policy with a managed installer! You now have a WDAC Policy with a managed installer! From here, we should start to see a code integrity policy inC:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\CiPolicies\\Active Now wait till the policy gets pushed to your test device! Right now, our folder is still empty, but after a few minutes, we will see that a new .cip codeintegrity file is placed in the folderC:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\CiPolicies\\Active.This shows that your base code integrity policy is delivered & activated, which means the process was successful. You can even see this happen live if you go into Codeintegrity (pathway: Event viewer -> Windows -> Codeintegrity)! Refreshed and activated Code Integrity policy {1f27a095-4a5b-441e-bd09-faff25790e0d} BasePolicyPMPC. id 2023-11-12. Status 0x0 If we test this by running an existing \u201cNon-Microsoft\u201d application, let\u2019s say Notepad++, we should see that WDAC blocks its execution. This shows that WDAC policy works. Under System Information, you can also verify if WDAC is enabled in audit or enforced mode. Step 4: Make a Custom Supplemental Policy for Patch My PC Note: Skip this part to continue with the Scappman implementation Now, let\u2019s make additional policies with PowerShell instead of the WDAC Wizard. I quickly grabbed an install package from the IME cache folder and copied it over to another location in my OneDrive. I will now scan the install package from Patch My PC with PowerShell. Here are the steps: 1.Create a new policy: The PowerShell New-CIPolicy creates a new Code Integrity policy (WDAC policy) as an .xml file (Note: I had to add the parameter -UserPE to include user-mode files. Otherwise, you will end up with an .xml that has no information in it!). 2.Now change this to a supplemental policy with the \u201cSet-CIPolicyIdInfo\u201d command. You can now check in your supplemental policy if the Base Policy ID is added like the picture below. Be aware that this could take some time after you run the PowerShell command. 3.Now add the supplemental policy .xml file to your App control for Business Configuration settings page. We can spot when the new code integrity policy is created in the folderC:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\CiPolicies\\ActiveYou can also spot a new WDAC policy getting deployed when you see the 3099 event ID in event viewer. Note:Due to a known issue, PowerShell scriptsdo notwork when you use pre-install or post-install scripts with the PMPC publisher We apologize for the inconvenience and are working on a fix. In the meantime, you can use one of these workarounds: Use the option to ignore PowerShell script errors while installing. Use the option to ignore PowerShell script errors while installing. Disable Script Enforcement in your WDAC policy, but this is not as highly recommended because it disables a great feature of WDAC. Disable Script Enforcement in your WDAC policy, but this is not as highly recommended because it disables a great feature of WDAC. Step 5: Create a Supplemental Policy for Scappman with WDAC Wizard. Now let\u2019s make WDAC and the managed installer work with Scappman! We will need to create another supplemental policy for Scappman. This time we are going to do this without PowerShell and do it again with theWDAC Wizardso you\u2019ll be able to see examples of using both tools. Let\u2019s make the app Notepad++ available with Scappman. We need to scan the app package with WDAC Wizard before we can install it. To do this, we have to copy the install package from the folderC:\\WindowsIMECacheas soon as it appears there. You must be quick, because it will not stay there for long!The app installation will fail the first time because we have not added a supplemental policy for Scappman. This is normal and expected. Windows App Control For Business (WDAC) will block the installation until we scan the package and create a policy. We need to scan the app package with WDAC Wizard before we can install it. To do this, we have to copy the install package from the folderC:\\WindowsIMECacheas soon as it appears there. You must be quick, because it will not stay there for long!The app installation will fail the first time because we have not added a supplemental policy for Scappman. This is normal and expected. Windows App Control For Business (WDAC) will block the installation until we scan the package and create a policy. After we copy the installer file to another location, we can delete all the files in the original folder because we no longer need them. We don\u2019t need to scan the actual installer packages, either. The managed installer Applocker policy will sign every file that the application writes to disk for us. After we copy the installer file to another location, we can delete all the files in the original folder because we no longer need them. We don\u2019t need to scan the actual installer packages, either. The managed installer Applocker policy will sign every file that the application writes to disk for us. Now open the WDAC Wizard tool and scan the installer package folder with the following steps: Select Policy Creator Select Policy Creator Add a new Supplemental Policy Name and select your previous Base Policy ID (Note: When you select your Base Policy .xml the WDAC Wizard Tool will automatically extract your Base Policy ID.). Add a new Supplemental Policy Name and select your previous Base Policy ID (Note: When you select your Base Policy .xml the WDAC Wizard Tool will automatically extract your Base Policy ID.). Just completely skip the Configure Policy Template page, since it is only useful when you create a Base Policy. Click Next. Just completely skip the Configure Policy Template page, since it is only useful when you create a Base Policy. Click Next. Create a new policy rule. Create a new policy rule. Add the rule scope Usermode Rules / Rule type: Folder Scan /Scan Rule Level Publisher. Click create rule (and if a popup with a warning appears, just click Yes). Done! Your Supplemental Policy will be created and saved in the location of your choosing. Let\u2019s check what is in your created supplemental policy. In the picture below, we can spot the Basepolicy ID that links the Base Policy and the Scappman Signature. Now, enter the XML data as a supplemental policy in the App Control for Business Configuration page. Now, enter the XML data as a supplemental policy in the App Control for Business Configuration page. In order to run PowerShell in full-language mode, we need to add the Scappman PowerShell certificate to the local machine certificate store (note: PowerShell scripts need to be codesigned and trusted in the root certificate store). You can download the Scappman PowerShell Certificate here:Scappman PowerShell Certificate\u2014Scappman Support Center. Runcertlm.msc Runcertlm.msc We will need to add the Certificate to the Trusted Root Certification. We will need to add the Certificate to the Trusted Root Certification. There is also a configuration template in Intune to deploy your certificate. After the import, you should see the Scappman Certificate here. Yes, we\u2019re almost finished, but if you try to run your install script now it will fail! Why? Because ofDot sourcing! Dot sourcing a script means running the commands in the script as if you entered them into the console. This puts the script in interactive mode, which is restricted by WDAC if you have enabled script enforcement in your base policy. This restriction applies even to signed scripts.Using the -file parameter to run a script, such aspowershell.exe -file ./yourscript.ps1, also puts the script in interactive mode and under WDAC restriction.However, if you omit the -file parameter and run a script like this: powershell.exe ./yourscript.ps1, the script runs in non-interactive mode and full-language mode. This allows the PSADT script to use all the features of PowerShell. So we will change our Notepad++ install command to the following: So we will change our Notepad++ install command to the following: Now, your application will deploy with both Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) and the managed installer. Now, your application will deploy with both Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) and the managed installer. Well done! Conclusion and Best Practices In this guide, I didn\u2019t utilize Audit mode as I used my personal WDAC Intune lab environment to test and deploy the apps. However, in a real-world enterprise scenario, starting with Audit mode and disabling Script enforcement is crucial. The best way to start is to install a device with all the existing allowed software and drivers that you need (a \u201cgolden image,\u201d if you will), then scan that device with the \u201cNew-CIPolicy -ScanPath\u201d or WDAC Wizard tool. You then begin whitelisting based on the warnings observed in your event viewer logs or log analytics logs. This process is not straightforward and can be quite labor-intensive in existing environments. Implementing and deploying WDAC in your Windows Defender stack requires a collective effort from your team, including all employees and decision-makers. It\u2019s a task that demands significant work, but it\u2019s well worth the commitment! I also want to emphasize that you have the flexibility to create multiple custom Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. I recommend creating separate policies for drivers, PowerShell scripts, and applications. This approach allows you to add more rules in the future by merging them with an existing policy. There is also the option to sign your WDAC policies to prevent tampering. For more information, you can read more on policy signing here:Use signed policies to protect Windows Defender Application Control against tampering \u2013 Windows Security | Microsoft Learn. I also didn\u2019t touch upon the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph (ISG) in this guide. ISG enables apps with a good reputation to gain trusted status automatically. However, since we don\u2019t know which apps are included in this list, utilizing this technology can feel like taking a shot in the dark. That said, store apps are automatically allowed with the base policy we deployed, but Windows line of business apps will not work. Since they are not deployed through the managed installer, they must be whitelisted in additional rules. Lastly, I recommend deploying the Windows recommended blocklist for Windows Defender Application Control. This is a list of known drivers with vulnerabilities that Microsoft updates twice a year. You can read more info here: Microsoft recommended driver block rules\u2014Windows Security | Microsoft Learn. With all of these practices in mind, you can make the most of App Control for Business in your environment.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/ime-sync-event-log-retry/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Unveiling Microsoft\u2019s New Sync Event Log and the wonderful Backoff/Retry Mechanisms Earlier this week,I discussed the discovery of a new log file, AppWorkload.log, from the Intune Management Extension, highlighting its importance in app deployment and troubleshooting. In this blog, we\u2019ll continue exploring the latest developments by diving into another significant update: the new Sync event log and the backoff/retry feature introduced by Microsoft. This new Sync log and retry mechanism are designed to improve device management reliability, especially in environments with network challenges. We\u2019ll explore the BackOff AKA Retry feature, its implementation, and why it\u2019s critical for stable and efficient device management. Introduction to the new Retry Schedule In modern enterprise environments, devices must constantly communicate with management servers to receive updates, apply configurations, and report status. This continuous communication is vital for maintaining security, compliance, and functionality across an organization\u2019s IT infrastructure. However, network conditions are not always optimal\u2014connectivity issues, DNS failures, or server unavailability can disrupt these communications. To manage such disruptions gracefully, the OMA-DM (Open Mobile Alliance Device Management) client got a nice update. In the latest27686.1000 Windows Canary Build, Microsoft implemented a sophisticated \u201cbackoff\u201d mechanism. The Concept of Backoff/Retry in OMA-DM Client The backoff mechanism is essentially a controlled retry logic designed to handle temporary communication failures between the client device and the management server. When the OMA-DM client encounters a failure\u2014such as a DNS resolution error or a network timeout\u2014it doesn\u2019t immediately retry. Instead, it introduces a delay before attempting to reconnect. This delay, which increases progressively with each subsequent failure, is intended to prevent overwhelming the network, reduce unnecessary power consumption, and allow time for the issue to be resolved. The backoff mechanism is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of device management processes. This could be a big deal in environments where thousands of devices might be trying to connect to the server simultaneously. How the Backoff Mechanism is Triggered The backoff mechanism is triggered by specific error conditions encountered by the OMA-DM client during its operations. One such condition is a DNS resolution failure. This is a common scenario where the device cannot resolve the server\u2019s hostname. This could be due to network issues or DNS server problems. The moment a DNS error occurs, the corresponding error,0x80072ee7, will be logged in the new Sync event log. This event will trigger the backoff process to manage the sync retries more effectively. Detailed Examination of the BackOff Mechanism Let\u2019s examine how this back-off mechanism works, step by step. Sync Operation Begins: The Backoff process begins when the device attempts to sync with the server. This is managed by the SendDataToServer function in the omadmclient.exe. The Backoff process begins when the device attempts to sync with the server. This is managed by the SendDataToServer function in the omadmclient.exe. The function is responsible for sending the device\u2019s data to the server for synchronization. The function is responsible for sending the device\u2019s data to the server for synchronization. DNS Error Occurs: During the sync process, a DNS resolution failure can occur. This is a common network-related error represented by the error code0x80072EE7 (ERROR_INTERNET_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED). During the sync process, a DNS resolution failure can occur. This is a common network-related error represented by the error code0x80072EE7 (ERROR_INTERNET_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED). The SendDataToServer function detects this error and triggers the backoff mechanism. The SendDataToServer function detects this error and triggers the backoff mechanism. Logging the DNS Error in the Sync Event lo: When the DNS error is detected, it is logged in the new Sync event log (DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-ProviderSync). The event log captures the 0x80072ee7 error message and notes that a backoff retry will be attempted. When the DNS error is detected, it is logged in the new Sync event log (DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-ProviderSync). The event log captures the 0x80072ee7 error message and notes that a backoff retry will be attempted. Registry Key Check Before the retry scheduled task is created, it checks specific registry keys to determine the backoff time. Before the retry scheduled task is created, it checks specific registry keys to determine the backoff time. This registry key specifies the initial delay (in milliseconds) before the first retry attempt after detecting a failure. The backoff mechanism uses this value to determine how long to wait before trying to sync again. This registry key defines the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the system will wait between retries. If multiple failures occur, the backoff time may increase exponentially up to this maximum value Creating the Backoff Retry Task: Once the DNS error is logged and the current omadm setings are checked, the system prepares to retry the sync operation. To manage this retry, a scheduled task is created using the ScheduleBackOffRetryTask function. Once the DNS error is logged and the current omadm setings are checked, the system prepares to retry the sync operation. To manage this retry, a scheduled task is created using the ScheduleBackOffRetryTask function. This function creates a task in the Windows Task Scheduler (Microsoft\\Windows\\EnterpriseMgmt\\SessionRetry.) that will attempt to retry the sync after a specified delay. This function creates a task in the Windows Task Scheduler (Microsoft\\Windows\\EnterpriseMgmt\\SessionRetry.) that will attempt to retry the sync after a specified delay. Queueing the Retry Task: The task is queued in the Windows Task Scheduler and waits for the specified backoff time before retrying the sync operation. The task is queued in the Windows Task Scheduler and waits for the specified backoff time before retrying the sync operation. This task is critical to ensuring that the device does not continuously retry too quickly, which could overload the server or cause further issues. This task is critical to ensuring that the device does not continuously retry too quickly, which could overload the server or cause further issues. Retry Execution: After the backoff time has elapsed, the scheduled task executes the sync operation again. After the backoff time has elapsed, the scheduled task executes the sync operation again. During each retry, the registry may be updated with details such as RetryDelay, reflecting the delay calculated for the next retry. This allows the system to keep track of how long it has waited between retries.

The task uses parameters such as the InitiationID (a GUID that uniquely identifies the session) to track the retry session. The task uses parameters such as the InitiationID (a GUID that uniquely identifies the session) to track the retry session. Task Deletion: Once the retry session succeeded and the sync is successful again, the queued retry scheduled task is automatically deleted to prevent it from running unnecessarily. Once the retry session succeeded and the sync is successful again, the queued retry scheduled task is automatically deleted to prevent it from running unnecessarily. This cleanup ensures that only necessary tasks are present in the Task Scheduler, maintaining system efficiency. This cleanup ensures that only necessary tasks are present in the Task Scheduler, maintaining system efficiency. Logging the Successful Sync in the new Sync Event log: The new Sync event log is updated to reflect the successful completion of the sync operation. The new Sync event log is updated to reflect the successful completion of the sync operation. This log entry indicates that the backoff mechanism worked as intended and that the device is now synchronized. This log entry indicates that the backoff mechanism worked as intended and that the device is now synchronized. This detailed process ensures that devices can recover from network-related issues like DNS resolution failures and eventually complete their sync operations, maintaining compliance and up-to-date configurations. Let\u2019s zoom into the registry details and the event log a bit more. The backoff mechanism registry keys The backoff mechanism relies heavily on registry settings to determine the behavior of retry attempts. These registry keys are stored under specific paths within the Windows Registry, which the OMA-DM client reads and writes to during its operation. Key registry values include: InitialBackOffTime: This DWORD value sets the initial delay before the first retry attempt. The value is typically represented in milliseconds, with 0x00007530 equating to 30,000 milliseconds or 30 seconds. This time is crucial as it prevents immediate and repeated retry attempts that could further strain the network. InitialBackOffTime: This DWORD value sets the initial delay before the first retry attempt. The value is typically represented in milliseconds, with 0x00007530 equating to 30,000 milliseconds or 30 seconds. This time is crucial as it prevents immediate and repeated retry attempts that could further strain the network. MaxBackOffTime: Another DWORD value that sets the upper limit on the backoff time. For instance, 0x0001d4c0 represents 120,000 milliseconds or 120 seconds. This cap ensures that even after multiple failed attempts, the retry mechanism doesn\u2019t delay indefinitely, allowing for periodic retrying to check if the network condition has improved. MaxBackOffTime: Another DWORD value that sets the upper limit on the backoff time. For instance, 0x0001d4c0 represents 120,000 milliseconds or 120 seconds. This cap ensures that even after multiple failed attempts, the retry mechanism doesn\u2019t delay indefinitely, allowing for periodic retrying to check if the network condition has improved. ConnRetryFreq: This value controls how frequently retries should occur after the initial backoff time, providing a balance between giving enough time for potential network recovery and ensuring that retries are not too sparse to cause unnecessary delays. ConnRetryFreq: This value controls how frequently retries should occur after the initial backoff time, providing a balance between giving enough time for potential network recovery and ensuring that retries are not too sparse to cause unnecessary delays. ServerLastAccessTime, ServerLastFailureTime, ServerLastSuccessTime: These string values store timestamps of the last successful server access, the last failed attempt, and the last successful attempt, respectively. These are critical for diagnostics and understanding the communication patterns between the client and server. ServerLastAccessTime, ServerLastFailureTime, ServerLastSuccessTime: These string values store timestamps of the last successful server access, the last failed attempt, and the last successful attempt, respectively. These are critical for diagnostics and understanding the communication patterns between the client and server. These values are usually managed programmatically by the OMA-DM client and provide the flexibility to fine-tune the retry behavior depending on specific deployment scenarios. Let\u2019s take a look at the new Sync Event log Throughout the backoff and retry process, detailed logs are generated and can be found in the Windows Event Viewer under DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Providersync. Notably, the new Sync event log plays a critical role in enhancing visibility into synchronization activities, making it easier to distinguish between different types of events. These logs capture events such as: The creation of a retry task The creation of a retry task The scheduling of the retry session The scheduling of the retry session The success or failure of retry attempts The success or failure of retry attempts Detailed information in the Sync event log, which provides insights into synchronization processes and related issues Detailed information in the Sync event log, which provides insights into synchronization processes and related issues The eventual outcome of the session, whether it succeeded or ultimately failed The eventual outcome of the session, whether it succeeded or ultimately failed By splitting the event logs, it becomes more evident which log is responsible for what, thereby allowing administrators to more effectively diagnose and resolve issues. These logs are invaluable for administrators who need to troubleshoot issues related to device management and understand why certain devices might be falling behind in updates or configurations. Conclusion The backoff feature within the OMA-DM client is a sophisticated mechanism designed to handle the realities of networked environments, where connections are not always stable or reliable. By intelligently managing retry attempts and leveraging the Windows Task Scheduler, the OMA-DM client ensures that devices remain in communication with management servers without overwhelming the network or the server itself. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for IT administrators, as it provides insights into how devices handle communication failures and ensures that retries are done in a controlled and efficient manner. By leveraging this understanding, organizations can ensure smoother device management operations, even in challenging network environments.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remote-code-execution-vulnerability/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability What is Remote Code Execution vulnerability and how can you protect yourself and your organization? Remote code execution (RCE)attacks are a type of cyberattack in which an attacker executesarbitrary or malicious codeon a victim\u2019s machine, typically via a vulnerable software application or service. This type of vulnerability can lead to a variety of attacks including data theft, system compromise, the installation of malware or ransomware on the target machine, and using the compromised system to launch further attacks. To prevent RCE vulnerability attacks, it is critical to implement safe and secure computer practices, such as keeping software up to date, using strong passwords, and avoiding questionable emails and links. Arbitrary Code Execution:Any code or programming instruction that can be executed on computer system without built-in restrictions or protections is referred to asarbitrary code. This means that arbitrary or dynamic code execution could be used to do unauthorized or malicious actions on a system, such as stealing data, destroying files, and gaining control of the system. Example: Note:Please do not run this code.This code asks the user to enter a password, and if the password is correct, it deletes all files in the user\u2019s home directory. This could cause irreparable damage to the user\u2019s computer and is an example of why arbitrary code execution is a serious security threat. What are the roots of RCE and why does it happen? Remote Code Execution attacks have their roots in the early days of computers and the development of networked systems. The possibility of attackers exploiting RCE rose as systems got increasingly interconnected, leading to the development of various security solutions such as firewalls and data encryption. But, as technology has advanced, so have attack strategies and their sophistication. The proliferation ofsoftware vulnerabilitiesis one of the biggest reasons for the increase in remote code execution attacks. The number of potential vulnerabilities has expanded tremendously as software has become more complicated and widely used, giving attackers a diverse set of targets to exploit. Another root cause of RCE attacks is the growing importance of data and information in the digital age. With data becoming the lifeblood of many organizations, attackers see valuable data as a key target, making RCE attacks an attractive option for accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information. RCE attacks occur for several reasons, including: Software vulnerabilities: Hackers use software flaws and internal vulnerabilities to execute remote code. Inadequate remote machine and user input validation: Hackers use insufficient remote code evaluation and user input validation to run remote code on vulnerable device. Outdated software: Vulnerable to remote code execution attacks. Weak or default user inputs passwords: Allow hackers to easily gain access to systems and execute remote code. Social engineering: Hackers lure individuals into remotely executing harmful malware. Third-party integrations: Can bring weaknesses, vulnerable code, and application code into a network that hackers can exploit. Malicious file downloads: Can be used by hackers to run remote code on systems. Impact:Data Theft | System Compromise | Network Infiltration | Service Disruption | Reputation Damage RCE attack types and examples of known RCE vulnerabilities Attacks exist in different types. Some common ones are: Command Injection:An attacker uses this to exploit a vulnerability in an application by injecting arbitrary commands. The attacker sends the program a malicious payload, which then executes the injected instruction. SQL Injection:In this type of attack, an attacker exploits a database vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code. The attacker can modify the database data or possibly acquire system access. Remote File Inclusion:A file from a remote server is included by an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in a web application. By including a malicious file, the attacker can run arbitrary executable code. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):An attacker injects malicious code into a web application in order to steal data, reroute visitors to other websites, and to execute arbitrary code. Examples of known Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities Several significant RCE vulnerabilities exist: Windows SMB RCE Vulnerability (WannaCry)\u2013 CVE-2017-0143 Microsoft Windows Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2019-0708 Adobe Flash Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2018-4878 Google Chrome Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2023-0928 Oracle WebLogic Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2019-2725 VMware vCenter Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2021-21972 Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u2013 CVE-2021-26855 What is the impact of RCE attacks? RCE attacks are a sort of cyberattack in which an attacker gains unauthorized access to a system or application and remotely runs arbitrary code. This has a wide range of implications, including: Data theft: RCE vulnerabilities can be used to steal sensitive data such as financial data, personal information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. Malware propagation: RCE can also be used to transfer malware and viruses to other computers, potentially inflicting extensive harm and causing disruption. System compromise: A RCE vulnerability allows attackers to gain complete control of a system, which will then allow them to execute arbitrary code to modify, delete, or clear system memory, steal data, install backdoors, execute commands, and change system settings. Service disruption: An RCE attack can be used to launch denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making a system or web application inaccessible to users. Reputation damage:A successful RCE assault can damage the reputation of a company or individual, resulting in legal liability, loss of revenue, and regulatory fines. Financial loss:Because of asset theft, revenue loss, and the cost of remediation and recovery activities, RCE assaults can result in considerable financial losses. How to find Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities are a critical security flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands via code injection on a remote system without requiring physical access. Here are some approaches to finding RCE vulnerabilities: Manual testing:RCE vulnerabilities might be difficult to identify with automated scanners, so manual testing is essential. This includes testing the injection and execution of malicious code in web user input fields, intercepting and manipulating traffic, and exploiting known software flaws. You can use tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, or Burp Suite to scan the target web application for vulnerabilities. Examine code for common vulnerabilities:RCE vulnerabilities occur frequently when code is not adequately vetted or sanitized. Examine the code for typical flaws such as buffer overflows, overflows errors, SQL injections, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Monitor for suspicious activity: Employ network and system monitoring tools to keep an eye out for suspicious activity, such as unapproved remote code execution and odd network traffic. Understand the technology:Begin by learning about the potential problems the technologies you will be programming for. This includes being familiar with the programming language, web framework, and any third-party libraries or tools that may be used to execute code. Perform a vulnerability scan:Scan the system for RCE attacks and other common vulnerabilities using an automated vulnerability scanner tool. These tools can detect common RCE attack vectors and vulnerabilities in web applications, operating systems, and network protocols in a matter of seconds. How to fix Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities Patching: Ensure that all software and systems are up to date with the most recent security updates. Ensure that all software components, including the operating system, systems, applications, and libraries, are constantly updated.This helps to prevent code injection and vulnerabilities from being exploited. Learn howPatch My PC can reduce vulnerabilities within your ConfigMgr and Intune environment by automating Third-Party Patches. Secure coding practices: Follow secure coding practices and perform regular code reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities in the codebase. Code signing:Use code signing to confirm that software is authentic and evaluated code has not been tampered with. Learn more aboutWSUS Signing Certificates in regard to third-party software updatesorCertificate Configuration from Patch My PC. Network segmentation: Implement network segmentation to separate critical assets and limit the spread of malicious malware in case of a breach. Least privilege: Ensure that all users of web apps and systems of web server have only the permissions necessary to the web server and apps and perform their tasks. Secure configurations: Implement secure configurations for all systems, device web applications, and web applications. Long term prevention strategies for Remote Code Execution By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of RCE and keep your system and data safe.The first four strategies are recommended for most use case scenarios. Keep your software up to date:Make sure you are running the latest version of all your software, including your operating system, web browsers, and other applications. Software updates often contain security patches that fix vulnerabilities, including those that could lead to RCE. Disable unnecessary services: If you are not using a particular service or feature, consider disabling it. This can reduce the attack surface of your system and minimize the risk of RCE. Be cautious when opening attachments:Be very diligent around email attachments, especially those from unknown senders. Do not open attachments unless you are expecting them and know they are safe. Use two-factor authentication:Two-factor authentication can add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of authentication in addition to your password. This can help prevent attackers from gaining access to your accounts even if they have your password. Disconnect from the network: The first step is to disconnect the infected system from the network. This will prevent the attack from spreading to other network devices. Inform the security team: Notify the security team or IT department of the suspected attack as quickly as possible. They can take the necessary steps to confine the assault, identify its source, and prevent it from spreading. Isolate the system: To prevent the spread of the attack, isolate the affected system from other systems and devices. This can be accomplished by disconnecting the network cable, turning off Wi-Fi, or removing the infected device from the network. Disable remote access: If the attack is launched via a remote access tool, disable remote access to prevent the attacker from continuing the attack. Detection strategies Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):By monitoring network traffic and alerting managers whenever unusual activity is discovered, IDS can be used to identify and mitigate RCE attacks. Examples: SolarWinds Security Event Manager, ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer, ManageEngine Log360. Log monitoring:Examine system logs for strange patterns or actions that may indicate an RCE attack. Examples: Datadog Log analysis and troubleshooting, SolarWinds Security Event Manager, Sematext Logs, Splunk. Endpoint Security: Install endpoint security software that monitors system activity and warns administrators when suspicious activity is discovered. Network security solutions can also be used. Examples: ESET, Crowdstrike, Sophos, Manage Engine Endpoint Central, Symantec Endpoint Protection. Behavioral analysis:Use behavioral analysis tools to detect and prevent anomalous behaviors that may signal an RCE assault. Vulnerability scanning: Do vulnerability scans on a regular basis to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in software and systems. Examples: Qualys, Crowdstrike Nmap, Tripwire.Check outPatch My PC\u2019s CVE Import Wizard feature for Matching CVE IDsfor increased awareness ofvulnerabilities within your environment.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/deploy-microsoft-365-apps-office/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Deploy Microsoft 365 apps with the Office portal Introduction The recommended way to deploy Microsoft 365 in an organization is through the config.office.com portal. This site helps IT administrators deploy, manage, monitor, and secure Microsoft 365 apps within their organizations. This blog will focus on the deployment of Microsoft 365. What isconfig.office.com? Config.office.comis a web-based portal provided by Microsoft that allows administrators to manage and configure Office settings across their organization. This tool simplifies the deployment process by providing a centralized location to configure policies, manage devices, and deploy applications. It\u2019s an essential tool for any IT administrator looking to leverage Microsoft 365 to its fullest potential. History ofconfig.office.com Theconfig.office.comportal, also known as the Office Customization Tool for Click-to-Run, was launched in preview in October 2018. This portal was introduced to simplify the customization and deployment of Office 365 applications, providing administrators with a centralized and user-friendly interface to manage Office configurations. Let\u2019s get started Sign in to the Portal:Visitconfig.office.comand sign in with your administrative credentials. When you sign in, you will probably see some recommendations. The top recommendation is cloud update. It\u2019s a tool to streamline your Microsoft 365 update management. I highly recommend looking into this and enabling it! Please read this article from the Microsoft docs: Cloud update Microsoft 365 Apps Let us open on the left pane Customization > Device configuration > Click on the + Create Create a name: PMPC-M365 Choose Bitness: 32bit or 64bit Choosing the proper Microsoft 365 Apps: Office Suites:You have two big options for Microsoft 365. Business or Enterprise Choose Business if you are a smaller business with a Microsoft 365 business license. Choose enterprise if you have a Microsoft 365 enterprise license like E3, E5. You will have a choice for Visio and Project. It may be interesting for you to always include Visio and Project in your base Microsoft 365 installation. This could potentially save you some extra work, assigning and configuring additional Visio and Project installations later. The downside of this approach is the extra disk space that will be used. A Visio install takes up to 3GB, and a Project install takes up to 2GB. You can always opt to create an additional configuration XML that adds Visio or Project later. The same applies to extra languages called Language Packs. In this blog, we will discuss adding extra language packs and components like Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Project further. Update Channels and Update Rings Keeping Microsoft 365 Apps up-to-date is essential for security and productivity. Microsoft offers three update channels tailored to different needs. Here\u2019s a quick overview to help you choose the right one: Best For:Users who need the latest features immediately. Best For:Users who need the latest features immediately. Update Frequency:At least once a month, with no set schedule. Update Frequency:At least once a month, with no set schedule. Support Duration:Until the next version is released, usually around one month. Support Duration:Until the next version is released, usually around one month.

Best For:Critical environments requiring extensive testing. Update Frequency:Twice a year, in January and July. Update Frequency:Twice a year, in January and July. Support Duration:Fourteen months. Support Duration:Fourteen months. Apps Choosing Microsoft 365 apps is straightforward. Microsoft Teams is not included due to EU and Swiss regulations, even when you do not exclude it from the XML ! More info here:New subscription structure for Microsoft 365 in Europe Microsoft 365 Apps: Languages Pick your language, additional languages, and proofing tools. Installation Choose the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) to always get the latest up-to-date installer from the nearest Microsoft Datacenter. Upgrade I recommend uninstalling and auto-upgrading existing M365 installations. Activate License Most will use the user license version here, and I will choose to accept the license terms automatically. Deploying the Microsoft 365 Apps The final step is to deploy your new Office 365 configuration by adding it as a Microsoft 365 app in Intune. Intune will now initiate your installation using the Office Deployment Toolkit (ODT), executing the following command to perform the setup: Deploy Visio and Project in a robust and flexible way: You have the option to include Visio and Project in your base Microsoft 365 installation, which can simplify future licensing and setup tasks. However, this uses significant disk space\u2014up to 3GB for Visio and 2GB for Project. To save space on devices without licenses, it\u2019s better to exclude them. When deploying Visio and Project apps, focus on reliable configurations and leverage the Office Deployment Tool to avoid hardcoding. Using an XML fromconfig.office.commay restrict deployment to specific channels. This could quickly lead to issues in mixed environments with varying languages and update channels. Let me show you in effect: When you import this .xml in your Intune portal to create an installation, it will only succeed when you have an NL language and your update channel is Current. Chances are that in a messy, more uncontrolled environment, you have different variants installed on your devices. We can do this a lot better by leveraging the capabilities of the ODT installer. Let\u2019s look at this .xml code: Many things have improved! We\u2019ve added support forMatchInstalledto align with the language, version, and update channel already on the device. We can now even install Visio on both 64-bit and 32-bit systems! If you want to deploy Project just change <Product ID=\u201dVisioProRetail\u201d> to <Product ID=\u201dProjectProRetail\u201d> in the .xml. The same approach could be used for extra language packs or Proofing tools. Conclusion: Efficiently deploying Microsoft 365 apps requires the right tools and strategies, and the combination of theconfig.office.comportal and theOffice Deployment Tool (ODT)makes this process seamless. By leveraging features likeMatchInstalled, administrators can align installations with existing device configurations, ensuring compatibility with languages, versions, and update channels already in use. The flexibility to customize XML configurations empowers IT teams to optimize deployments for specific needs, whether it\u2019s adding language packs, proofing tools, or managing Visio and Project installations smartly to save disk space on unlicensed devices.

We\u2019ll break down the Microsoft Entra ID Join process, what caused the delay, and how to fix it. But before we do, we need to thank\u00c1kosfor reaching out and bringing up this issue. Introduction After completing the Autopilot pre-provisioning process and resealing the device, the expected Entra Rejoin / Azure Ad Join process failed unexpectedly. Instead of completing the enrollment, the device was stuck at the \u201cPlease Wait while we set up your device\u201d screen for 10 minutes straight. After waiting exactly 10 minutes, the \u201cPlease wait while we set up your device\u201d screen changed to a nice error page showing the801c03ederror with theInvalid Token server message. This801c03ederror code often refers to administrator policies preventing devices from joining Microsoft Entra ID(the user is not allowed to enroll the device), but trust me, that wasn\u2019t the issue in this case. The registration setting specifies which users may join devices to Microsoft Entra was set toAll. After ruling out this simple issue, things got more interesting, especially since the error message also mentioned the\u201cInvalid Token.\u201d Let\u2019s dive in! Why the Device is Unjoined Post-Reseal Before diving into the Token failure, let\u2019s clarify why the device needs to join Entra again after finishing the Autopilot pre-provisioning process. It\u2019s pretty simple: The device needs to join Entra again because before resealing, it got an Entra unjoin. Let me explain why the unjoin needed to happen. Fake User Account (e.g., FooUser or Autopilot User): During Autopilot pre-provisioning, the device uses theAutopilot@domainnamefake user account to enroll in Entra. From then on, the device uses theFOOuser@domainnameaccount to enroll in Intune. (The device needs to join Entra to enroll in Intune) At this stage, the device is enrolled in Intune, but the actual user has not signed in, and the device\u2019s identity is tied to the pre-provisioning session and with it tied to thefoouser@ and autopilot@ user. Unjoin Before Reseal: Before the device is resealed, it must beunjoined from Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). This step clears the device\u2019s association with Entra ID to prepare it for a clean Entra Join when the actual user signs in. Conflicts could arise during the next enrollment if the device remains joined to Entra ID, as the device would still be tied to the pre-provisioning autopilot@ identity rather than the new user. State After Reseal: Once resealed, the device unjoins Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD. Since it is no longer Entra Joined, it is also no longer associated with the temporary fake user. This ensures the Entra Join / Azure Ad Join process occurs correctly when the actual user signs in, enabling the device to register with the correct user and policies. For more context on what happens before the reseal, refer to my earlier blog on the Autopilot pre-provisioning process:FooUser Autopilot Pre-Provisioning Fake User. Now that we know why the device needs to join Entra again after Autopilot pre-provisioning let\u2019s return to the issue. 10-Minute Delay before the Invalid Token After the deviceAutopilot for pre-provisioned deploymentwas finished, we booted up the device again. At this point, we needed to authenticate again to enroll the device in Entra, but this time with our own user credentials. After entering our credentials and waiting on the 10-minute delay, the Entra enrollment failed with the801c03ed error. Breaking Down the 10-Minute Delay Besides the801c03ed errorcode, it also told us that the token was invalid. At this stage, the device should have progressed toward Entra Join. Instead, users were stuck staring at the \u201cPlease wait while we set up your device\u201d screen for 10 minutes, only to see the enrollment fail with the error code801c03ed. With the enrollment failing, I started to wonder why\u2026. The Entra Join Flow: What Should Happen Let\u2019s examine the technical architecture of what should happen during the Entra Join. By understanding the flow well, we can spot where it breaks in combination with theMDM Diagnostics Logsand Fiddler traces. 1.User Signs In: The process begins when a user signs into the device with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) credentials and retrieves the token for the device join. 2.Device Discovers Tenant: The device queries the discovery endpoint to identify the associated Entra ID tenant. 3.Device Contacts DRS: TheDevice Registration Service (DRS)returns the required tenant configuration and endpoints for the registration process. 4.Device Sends Registration Request: A registration request is sent using a Transport Token to authenticate the device. 5.Transport Key Creation: If required, the TPM generates a newTransport Keythrough the following steps: Any existing Transport Keys are deleted. Parameters for the new key are validated. If an AIK Certificate is required, it is generated and validated alongside an attestation statement. If the key creation fails, errors are logged, and the process exits. A valid Transport Key is returned. 6.Transport Token Validation: Azure AD validates the Transport Token and associated device details. (of course, in this example below, the token is invalid and showed us the801c03edand the Invalid Tokenerror\u2026which is NOT expected behavior!) Azure AD validates the Transport Token and associated device details. (of course, in this example below, the token is invalid and showed us the801c03edand the Invalid Tokenerror\u2026which is NOT expected behavior!) 7.Azure AD Creates Device Object: A new Device Object is created in Azure AD to represent the enrolled device. 8.Device Receives Registration Response: The device receives enrollment data, including the Entra certificate and provisioning details. 9.Device Enrolled with Transport Key: The device is successfully enrolled with the Transport Key and associated cryptographic key. 10.Device Obtains PRT: The device obtains a Primary Refresh Token (PRT), enabling single sign-on (SSO) for Azure AD-integrated apps. 11.Device is Entra Joined: The device completes the join process and is fully onboarded to Entra ID (Azure Ad Joined) Fiddler Trace Analysis: Spotting the Issue Looking at the Fiddler traces showed us a critical insight into the delay and failure. Let me explain first before looking at a nice flow again: 1.Token Expiration: The bearer token sent toenterpriseregistration.windows.netfor the enrollment request was identical to the one obtained earlier fromlogin.microsoftonline.com. However, decoding the expires_on field revealed that the token had already expired when it was sent to Azure AD. 2.HTTP 400 Error: The EnrollmentServer/device/Enroll endpoint responded with a 400 Bad Request, logging Invalid Token in its JSON response. This clearly indicated that the expired Transport Token had caused the enrollment to fail. 3.10-Minute Delay: Comparing the timestamps in Fiddler, we observed a gap of approximately 10 minutes between the token acquisition and its usage. This delay aligned with the logs showing stalled Transport Key creation tasks. As shown above, the bearer token expiration highlighted the root cause: the request sent to the enterprise registration service was not completed in time. Something interfered with the TPM\u2019s ability to complete its operations after resealing the device. But what? At this point, we suspected that some background process wasn\u2019t running when it should have ETL Logs Analysis: Diving Deeper into the Invalid Token With the Fiddler trace showing the timeframe and pointing us toward a token issue, we opened the ETL trace that we got to find out more. When looking at theETL trace with the Windows Performance Analyzer, we also noticed the 10-minute window. Examining ETL traces provided further clarity on the 10-minute delay before sending out the domain join request: 1.Transport Key Deletion: RegistrationController::DeleteTransportKeyexecuted successfully, clearing the old transport key. 2.Transport Key Creation The logs revealed repeated attempts to create a new Transport Key viaRegistrationController::CreateTransportKey.However, the process only kicked off after 10 minutes. This confirmed that some funny stuff was interfering with the TPM\u2019s ability to complete its operations during the reseal phase\u2014specifically, its ability to create theTransport Key.To understand the root cause, it was time to dig deeper into the dsreg.dll code and TPM task handling. Dsreg.dll and the Entra Join By analyzing thedsreg.dllcode with the IDA tool, we started understanding the mechanics ofTransport Key creation. Please believe me\u2026 this is something you don\u2019t do for fun (well, I do.. but you get the point) We started by looking at theInitialize Join Requestfunction. This function is responsible for creating the certificate request and joining the device to Entra Join. When looking closer at this function, we spotted the exact same steps as we noticed in the Fiddler trace, from finding discovery metadata(discovery URLs)to performing the actual join. While looking through the code, I noticed the one I was looking for. As shown above, the Join request function also holds theCreateTransportKeyfunction.. this is where it got interesting. As shown above, thecreatetransportkey also checks If anAIK Certificateis required. If the AIK is required, the function should trigger an API ( to kick off theAIKCertEnroll) to retrieve it. In this scenario, the delayed execution of dependent tasks disrupted the Transport Key creation, leaving the Autopilot enrollment flow stuck. What Are the Transport Key (Token) and AIK Certificate? To fully understand the issue and its impact, it\u2019s pretty important to break down two key components in the Entra Join process: theTransport Keyand theAIK Certificate. These play critical roles in securely establishing the device\u2019s identity during enrollment. 1.Transport Key: The Backbone of Secure Communication As we also noticed in the ETL trace and Fiddler output, the Transport Key is pretty important. This transport key is a cryptographic key pair generated by the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) that forms the backbone of device authentication. Here\u2019s what it does: Public Portion: The public part of the Transport Key is wrapped in a secure payload (the Transport Token) and sent to Azure AD as part of the device\u2019s enrollment request. (what we also seen in the Fiddler trace) Device Authentication: This key proves to Azure AD that the request originates from a legitimate and trusted device. Expiration: If the Transport Token expires before validation, the device fails to join Entra ID. Timely creation and transmission of the key are critical. 2.AIK Certificate: Proving the Device\u2019s Trustworthiness The TPM issues the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) Certificate and attests to the device\u2019s identity and integrity. Azure AD uses this certificate to validate the Transport Key. Device Integrity: The AIK Certificate ensures the TPM is functioning correctly and has not been tampered with. Validation Role: Azure AD cross-checks the AIK Certificate during the enrollment process to confirm that the Transport Key comes from a trusted source. Dependent Tasks: The AIK Certificate generation often relies on TPM tasks like theAikcertenroll scheduled task.Any delay in these tasks can disrupt the entire enrollment flow. Why Are These Components Critical? Failures in either the Transport Key creation or the AIK Certificate generation disrupt the Entra Join process. Without a valid Transport Key, Azure AD cannot authenticate the device. Without an AIK Certificate, the integrity of the Transport Key cannot be validated. And now you are thinking\u2026. What on earth could possibly interfere with this process? Well, just hang on a bit\u2026 almost there! The AikCertEnrolltask The moment I spotted theAIK requirement\u2026 things started to make sense. Normally, a scheduled task should kick off these tasks, starting with theTPM maintenance task.As I pointed out in anolder blog, this TPM maintenance task also kicks off theAikCertEnrolltask. The AIK Cert enroll task! I kept an eye on those tasks while booting up after the device was sealed, but nothing happened with them! Even entering my credentials and waiting for 10 minutes before the801c03edshowed up didn\u2019t trigger those tasks. Doing the same kind of enrollment but from a different (working) tenant showed me thatWindows.Management.Service(Autopilot) kicked off those tasks, once the device boots up after it was pre-provisioned. From there, I had a stupid idea: What if I just manually executed those tasks before entering my credentials? I reinstalled the device, pre-provisioned it with Autopilot, and sealed it. After turning it on, I manually kicked off the TPM maintenance task\u2026 which took about 6 minutes to complete, which was pretty weird. From there on, I also executed theaikcertenrolltaskto be sure the device got the AIK. With the scheduled tasks completed successfully, I again entered my credentials. Instead of now staring at the please wait while setting up your device welcome screen, we were greeted with the Enrollment Status Page for a couple of seconds (Skipping the Account Setup) and the Windows Hello enrollment setup! So, triggering the TPM Maintenance task (which also triggers theAikCertEnrollTask) seems to have triggered the Entra join to be successful by fetching the AIK on forehand. The Culprit: Energy Saver Policy After doing some more extensive testing and comparing the Autopilot Pre-Provisioning enrollment flow with a working one, it started to look like background tasks were queued somehow. We traced the issue back to a funny Energy Saver policy applied to the device during White Glove to ensure the devices were carbon neutral. As shown above, setting thesetwo settings to 100will ensure the device is always in energy-saving mode. Guess what happens when a device is in energy-saving mode? As shown above, Microsoft\u2019sEnergy Saver documentationhighlights that task execution is restricted in this mode, which explains the behavior of the TPM-Maintenance task. Inside this TPM Maintenance task, we will spot theIdleSettings, which caused the issue. Delayed TPM Tasks: The policy delayed non-critical scheduled tasks, including theaikcertenroll and tpm-maintenance tasks, until the device exitedEnergy Saver mode. Token Expiry /Invalid Token: The resulting delay caused the Transport Token to expire before Azure AD could validate it. With the token expired we ended up with the801c03ederror and the Invalid Token message. The 801c03ed Fix: Adjusting the Policy To resolve the issue, we implemented a simple change: As shown above, reassigning the Energy Saver policy to users instead of devices ensured it didn\u2019t affect the pre-provisioning stages. Lessons Learned Policy Impact: Seemingly unrelated policies, like Energy Saver, can screw up yourAutopilot Pre-Provisioningpretty good 2.Logs Are always important: Use tools like Fiddler and ETL traces to find out why you got the801c03ed/ Invalid Token error. 3.Device Reseal State: A resealed device is unjoined and highly dependent on TPM functionality. Ensure workflows account for this state. 4.Manual Intervention: Temporarily triggering tasks manually can mitigate immediate issues during testing. Wrapping Up This case highlights how even minor policy changes can disrupt complex workflows like Entra Join. By understanding the flow, analyzing logs, and NOT enabling energy savers during Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployments, you can avoid similar issues in the future.

Update rings, feature updates, quality updates, and driver updates are all applied to different tabs. Prerequisites for Autopatch, including licensing, can be foundhere. It looks something like this: In Intune, you can schedule a delay for these updates, and the reg keys at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\Current\\Device\\Update will reflect any policy changes made. However, there are no maintenance windows available. The IME agent checks in once a day and will automatically download and install the updates as needed based on policy. Understanding PolicyState for Update Policies Another critical registry key to examine during troubleshooting is:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\UpdatePolicy\\PolicyState. This key provides essential details about the active Windows Update policies on the device, including: PolicySource:Identifies whether the policy is managed by MDM, Group Policy, or another source. PolicySource:Identifies whether the policy is managed by MDM, Group Policy, or another source. PolicyApplication:Confirms whether the policy has been successfully applied. PolicyApplication:Confirms whether the policy has been successfully applied. Policy Settings and Values:Displays the active policies, their configurations, and potential conflicts. Policy Settings and Values:Displays the active policies, their configurations, and potential conflicts. This is particularly useful for diagnosing devices impacted by updates such asKB4023057, which can reset MDM-managed devices to display as \u201cManaged by Group Policy.\u201d For example, if the device unexpectedly falls under Group Policy control, the PolicySource value will confirm the origin of the applied policies. Administrators can use this key to quickly identify conflicts or mismatches in update management, making it an essential part of any troubleshooting process Co-managed registry settings Part 1: Co-Managment is where things start to get a bit strange. Let\u2019s unpack it. This is where my current workload settings are for my test device. It\u2019s important to note that the registry changes will take effect on the device once the Windows Update policies are directed to Intune for that specific device. The registry keys remain the same whether the device is part of the Pilot Intune collection or if the slider is set fully to Intune for Windows Update Policies. Using the Pilot Intune setting is ideal for testing, as it only applies to the devices included in the collection under the \u201cStaging\u201d tab. We have an excellent blog onDual Scan. The purpose of this blog is to help users quickly identify where updates are coming from just by looking at the registry. However, the SCCM client will leave registry entries behind. The first thing that usually catches my eye are these options here in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate If the following keys are set to zero, the device pulls these from Windows Update (Intune). Accordingto Microsoft, \u201cIf no policies are configured: All of your updates will come from Windows Update.\u201d Again, going into the registry editor and editing the keys is not recommended. You can do it, but more often than not, the policy controlling these settings will just revert the settings that were manually changed. With the settings above, ConfigMgr is controlling these keys but the gpresult will show \u201cLocal Group Policy\u201d as the winning policy. But on this same device, we can review the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\Current\\Device\\Update location and see all of the Intune registry keys. Looking at the WindowsUpdate.log, we can see the MoUpdateOrchestrator is taking over again. Co-managed registry settings Part 2 To save myself from confusion later, the Client Policy was changed to Not Allow ConfigMgr to run Software Updates on Clients. After doing so, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate was completely removed. When Configuring Co-Management, you lose the ability to run third-party updates (unless you utilize dual scan). First-party (Microsoft) updates will work because they are downloaded directly from Microsoft. If you want third-party updates and plan on migrating workloads to Intune, enable the ClientApps workload for the same collection as your Windows Update policies. This way, if Patch My PC is building your updates in Intune, no loss of third-party patching will occur. Summary As you attempt to identify where the updates are coming from, run a group policy to see how these registry values are being controlled. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdateThis location is primarily used for WSUS or ConfigMgr This location is primarily used for WSUS or ConfigMgr HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager\\Current\\Device\\UpdateThis location is primarily used for Intune This location is primarily used for Intune Check the Windows Update Log (WindowsUpdate.log) We\u2019ve explored how Windows Update policies are managed across WSUS, ConfigMgr, Intune, and co-managed devices by understanding the role of registry keys. We\u2019ve seen how to identify where updates are coming from, when they\u2019re applied, and how they\u2019re controlled, all while emphasizing the importance of letting policies govern these settings to avoid conflicts. By focusing on the registry paths, logs, and policy structures, we can effectively troubleshoot and manage updates without introducing unnecessary complications.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/malware-vs-viruses/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Malware vs Viruses Latest Trends While estimating the exact number of annual malware attacks might be difficult due to under-reporting, according to the US-based Internet Crime Complaint Center, cyber crimes caused 12.5 billion dollars of damage in 2023. With various tools and tricks at bad actors\u2019 fingertips, it is crucial to learn the difference between different malware types and malicious software viruses, study examples of them, and prepare solutions for protecting yourself. What\u2019s the Difference? Malware is a broad term that refers to any malicious software. Viruses are a smaller subset of malware; this name is used for any self-replicating, user-triggered attack. Types of Malware Malware comes in many different shapes and sizes, from viruses to worms to Trojan horses. It is also important to remember that any particular malicious program can fall into multiple categories. For example, a backdoor can be set up via a worm. If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, don\u2019t worry! Let\u2019s look at a few particulars of each so this becomes a bit clearer. Viruses One of the cornerstones of a virus\u2019s definability is its ability to self-replicate. But how could harmful software do this practically, self-replicating itself across an environment until security is compromised? Let\u2019s take a closer look. A computer virus typically consists of three parts: the infection mechanism (how it spreads) the payload (its intended action) the trigger (what activates the payload). To me, these concepts are easiest explained in reverse order. A trigger, for example, can be something straightforward like meeting a specific date on the calendar before activating a payload. A simple instance of what a payload might do is deleting files across an infected computer. Then comes the infection mechanism, the most complex and vital of the three pieces. One of the most straightforward examples of an infection mechanism I\u2019ve seen is using Microsoft Word documents. Word can create and run macro programs, turning multi-step operations into simple button clicks. Say you create a document once a week that includes a table. It would be great to have a pre-formatted, pre-titled table populated each week without resizing it. This action could be turned into a macro where you lay out the steps once, and the entire process is repeated with a simple button trigger each time you need a new table. Do you see where we\u2019re headed? Viruses can be built upon these Microsoft Word macros, specifically by creating a file that runs a macro when opened and transmitting those harmful files to unknowing users. Safety Tip! Since many forms of viruses can infect your computer when you open a document from an untrusted source, always verify email attachments by double-checking the sender\u2019s email address for misspellings. Trojan Horses This malicious code disguises itself as a standard application or process that someone might use daily. For example, let\u2019s say Kevin is reading an article online. After reading the article\u2019s end, he scrolled and saw links to new articles. Here\u2019s where some social engineering and the Trojan horse come in: One of the articles shows an image of someone grasping their lower back, and the headline reads. \u201c3 Reasons Your Lower Back Hurts\u201d. Coincidentally, Kevin also has lower back pain and thinks this article would be worth reading. He clicks on the article. Then, out of nowhere, his browser rushes to a new website he is not familiar with. A download appears in the top right corner of his screen. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never had to download anything on this news site before\u2026\u201d Kevin thinks to himself. Boom, his computer is compromised by one click on that download link. Taking a step back with the ideas of best safety practices in mind, it is easy to see where the misstep occurred. Normally the way Kevin operates while reading articles is to read, scroll, click, read, scroll, click, sip coffee, read, scroll. So, when an article that plays to his own problems comes up, click it is! The Trojan horse in this situation is the fake lower back pain article, with the goal of the bad actors being to get that download on someone else\u2019s computer. Safety Tip! In the future, Kevin, be safer when doing your morning reading. Even tricks like hovering over the article so he could see the URL of where it was taking him might have helped avoid this situation altogether. Worms The line between viruses and computer worms is thin, but on a basic level, viruses usually self-replicate through mechanisms related to an infected application, whereas worms self-replicate using a computer network. Often, once a worm has duplicated itself across a network, the volume of normal tasks an affected organization can do drastically decreases as the worm\u2019s activity consumes bandwidth. While the average computer user may know some tips and behind-the-scenes tricks for handling the applications on their computer, computer networking is a highly technical field, so concepts like packets or protocols are not as broadly discussed. Spotting a bunch of pop-up windows on your computer after an application gets infected is a lot easier than knowing if your less-than-optimal internet download speeds are due to a cyber attack or simply more people showing up to the office on that day. Safety Tip! The critical factor for protecting yourself from computer worms is ensuring that your computer stays updated with the latest patches/updates. Ways to Stay Safe Malware protection takes various forms, from antivirus software to security training to ensuring your computer applications are patched regularly. Often, each solution has its own hurdles to entry: complicated setup processes or little support once you purchase a security solution are far too common. Patch My PC is different. When a vulnerability is revealed for applications in thePatch My PC catalog, customers can save crucial time by automating the packaging of third-party applications and updates in Intune.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/when-local-administrator-protection-epm/", "title": "", "raw_text": "When Local Administrator Protection and EPM Don\u2019t Get Along Microsoft recently announced theLocal Administrator Protection feature, a powerful tool for securing local admin accounts by isolating privileges and preventing token theft. However, when paired with Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM), things can get complicated. Local Administrator Protection focuses on locking down the admin account itself, while EPM is all about giving standard users temporary elevation for specific tasks. These overlapping functionalities can cause unexpected errors, making \u201cLocal Administrator Protection vs. Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM)\u201d a real headache for IT admins. If you have both features enabled, you\u2019re likely to run into issues that require more than a quick reboot to fix. Spoiler alert: this isn\u2019t the only challenge with Local Administrator Protection. Let\u2019s break down why these two features don\u2019t always get along and how to deal with the fallout. Local Administrator Protection vs. EPM: What\u2019s the Difference? Understanding the distinction between these two features is crucial for managing admin rights effectively. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown: Local Administrator Protection:This feature is designed to securelocal admin accountsby isolating their privileges and preventing token theft or misuse. It essentially locks down the admin account itself, ensuring that even if the account is compromised, the impact is minimized. It focuses on protecting theidentity and elevation processof the administrator account. Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM): On the other hand, EPM addresses a completely different need. It\u2019s aimed at empoweringstandard usersby enabling temporary privilege elevations for specific tasks, without granting full admin rights. EPM uses virtual accounts to provide these elevated permissions in a controlled and time-limited way, making it a great tool for organizations that need fine-grained control over admin privileges. The key difference?Local Administrator Protection is aboutsecuring admin accounts and their elevation process, whereas EPM is focused onempowering standard users with temporary, task-specific admin privileges. They serve distinct purposes but can sometimes overlap, creating conflicts when both are enabled in the same environment. The Problem: Virtual Accounts Clash Both Local Administrator Protection and EPM rely on something called \u201cvirtual accounts\u201c. When they\u2019re both enabled, things can go sideways fast. Here\u2019s what you might see: Error code:0x80004005 (-2147467259) What it means:EPM tried to create a virtual account, but Local Administrator Protection blocked it by locking down the admin token. For end users, it might look like this: \u201cThere was an error with running this app as administrator. Contact your support person. Error code:0x80004003 (-2147467261)\u201d This isn\u2019t just an annoyance; it\u2019s a full-on blocker to EPM\u2019s ability to handle privilege elevations. Microsoft\u2019s Take on the Issue Luckily, Microsoft has confirmed the conflict between these features: \u201cAdministrator Protection doesn\u2019t currently support elevations initiated from Endpoint Privilege Management. If organizations enable Administrator Protection on devices where standard users rely on EPM to handle elevation, the elevation will fail.\u201d (source) They\u2019ve acknowledged the issue and promised a fix in a future release. However, no timeline has been provided yet, so we\u2019re left to deal with it for now. What Can You Do About It? Until the official fix from Microsoft arrives, not much\u2026but here\u2019s how you can manage the situation: Choose Your Priority: Decide which feature is more critical. If EPM is essential for privilege elevations, consider holding off on enabling Local Administrator Protection. If securing local admin accounts is more important, focus on that for now.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-device-preparation-administrator-bug/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Autopilot Device Preparation and the Administrator Bug Setting up devices usingWindowsAutopilot Device Preparationshould be straightforward. To do so, we need to configure the policy, assign apps and scripts, and let the Windows Autopilot handle the rest. Whether a user should be a Standard User or an Administrator is just another setting in the Autopilot profile. But what happens when that setting is ignored? What if Autopilot Device Preparation finishes, yet the user remains anAdministrator?That\u2019s exactly what happened in this case, and finding out why led to an unexpected discovery. Autopilot Device Preparation and the Account Type Autopilot Device Preparation is the perfect solution to streamline your Entra and Intune enrollment during the OOBE process, ensuring that all policies and requiredapplicationsare deployed to the device. With a Device Preparation policy, we candefine up to 10 apps and 10 scriptsto be deployed automatically. Additionally, we can configure whether the user should be assigned as a local administrator or a standard user. But what if that doesn\u2019t work? Everything worked as expected on anEN-USWindows build. However, on aGermanWindows build, the enrolled user remained an administrator after provisioning despite the Device Preparation profile being correctly configured. The Issue: Standard User Configuration Didn\u2019t Apply This was unexpected. The device had gone through the full Autopilot Device Preparation process, yet the user still had administrative privileges. As shown below, the user was still a member of the \u201cadministratoren\u201d group. First Assumption: The UTC Timing Issue Given my experience with Autopilot timing issues, I suspected UTC-related problems. If tasks run at unexpected times due to time zone misalignment, certain provisioning steps could fail silently (as detailed in this blog:https://call4cloud.nl/autopilot-device-preparation-utc-issue/). I tested this theory by adjusting the device\u2019s UTC settings, manually forcing time synchronization, and ensuring all timestamps aligned. The result? No change. The user was still an Administrator. Time to move on. Second Assumption: The Entra Administrator Group Issue Next, I suspected that the Entra local administrator assignment was interfering. Autopilot DPP-enrolled devices did have some issues with this new Administrator setting in Entra. As covered inthis blog: So, I decided to check the Entra settings to be sure it wasn\u2019t the culprit. But that wasn\u2019t it either. Autopilot Device Preparation was completed successfully, and there were no conflicting Entra policies assigning admin rights. The issue had to be elsewhere. Debugging with the Bootstrapper Agent Log Provider Since the issue wasn\u2019t related to UTC or Entra admin assignments, I copied the necessary bootstrapper files from an already enrolled device from the to-be-enrolled device. With the folder and four required bootstrapper files in place, I enabled the Bootstrapper Agent Log Provider usingWevtutiland monitored the provisioning process. During deployment, I opened theBootStrapperAgent Event log,which now could hold more information because the event provider was already registered before enrollment. With the event log in place before enrollment, I checked the execution ofStandardUserProvider, which is responsible for removing the user from the Administrators group. That\u2019s when I noticed this important message in the event log. StandardUserProvider: Skipped StandardUserProviderwas skipped entirely. This explained why the user was never removed from the Administrators group. But why? Digging through the Bootstrapper agent code I opened the dot-peek tool and opened the bootstrapper agent dll file. With the bootstrapperagentcore.dll opened, I unfolded the standarduserprovider context After analyzing the decompiled BootstrapperAgent code, the issue became clear. The code suggested five possibilities for why the standarduserprovider could be skipped. (flight 7274 sounds interesting and deserves an additional blog) Flighting Feature ID 7274 is Disabled Flighting Feature ID 7274 is Disabled Provider Context is Null (Fails Initial Validation) Provider Context is Null (Fails Initial Validation) The user is Not in the Administrators Group The user is Not in the Administrators Group Invalid User SID Format Invalid User SID Format GroupHelper Fails to Remove User from Group GroupHelper Fails to Remove User from Group After looking at the possibilities, one of them stood out The StandardUserProvider uses this logic to find the Administrators group: using(GroupPrincipal byIdentity = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, \u201cAdministrators\u201d)); When we use PowerShell to execute that same function, it ends up with no results on a German Windows OS (even when the administrators group contained the logged-in user). When using that same code on a German device and a different working en-us Windows VM\u2026..this is what it showed me! As shown above\u2026 the left is the German one, and the right is the EN-US one. Shall I let you in on a secret? Why the User Stayed an Administrator This FindbyIdentity Function works on en-US OS builds but fails on a Windows device installed with the german language. Why? In the German language, the group is named \u201cAdministratoren\u201d instead of \u201cAdministrators.\u201d Because the method was hardcoded to look for \u201cAdministrators\u201d, it never found the group, and StandardUserProvider skipped execution. If we change the Samaccountname of the group to Administratoren, guess what it shows us? This means the user was never removed from the Administrators group during Autopilot Device Preparation. The Fix: They should use the Well-Known SID Instead of relying on localized group names, the correct approach is to use the well-known SID for the Administrators group (S-1-5-32-544), which remains the same across all languages. The correct implementation should be: using (GroupPrincipal byIdentity = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, IdentityType.Sid, \u201cS-1-5-32-544\u201d)); By using the SID instead of the hardcoded name, the group lookup works across all language versions, ensuring that StandardUserProvider executes correctly and removes the user from the Administrators group, no matter what language the OS is set to. Looking back, this is not the first time, Microsoft seems to have made this mistake. With releasing the 23h2 security baseline, they also managed to break some stuff on non-english builds. Microsoft Reference: IT773677 Conclusion: Localization Can Break Device Preparation This issue highlights a critical flaw in using hardcoded names for system groups\u2014localization can cause failures that don\u2019t exist on en-US builds. If you\u2019re troubleshooting Autopilot Device Preparation and find that a user remains an Administrator, check for: 1. Time synchronization issues (UTC problems) 2. Unexpected Entra admin assignments 3. StandardUserProvider skipping execution due to localization issues The fix is simple: always use the well-known SID for system groups. Otherwise, the user won\u2019t be removed from the administrator\u2019s group when it is required.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remove-default-microsoft-store-app-packages-windows11-25h2/", "title": "", "raw_text": "A Native Way to Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages This blog will focus on the new Windows 11 25h2 feature, \u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages.\u201d It\u2019s a long-awaited Group Policy and (eventually) Policy CSP setting that finally lets you remove a curated list of inbox Microsoft Store apps (bloatware) natively, without requiring PowerShell scripts. If you\u2019ve ever wanted a cleaner, bloatware-free Windows deployment, this new policy is worth checking out. Why We Needed This (And What We Had to Do Before) For as long as Windows 10 and 11 have shipped with their full set of built-in Microsoft Store apps, there has been demand from IT and sysadmins for a clean, supported way to remove the extras. Think of Sticky Notes, Solitaire, Quick Assist, Xbox, Clipchamp, apps that most enterprises don\u2019t want to show up for new users. Until now, the only way was to script the removal, typically using PowerShell. I covered all the headaches of that process inthis previous blog. Scripting isn\u2019t just ugly; it\u2019s fragile. If you remove something Windows expects, you risk breaking the OOBE flow, tripping up Autopilot, or even causing the Enrollment Status Page to hang. What we\u2019ve been asking Microsoft for is anative policyto quietly clear these apps during provisioning, without requiring extra scripts, detection hacks, or timing nightmares. And now, it looks like that\u2019s finally happening! When looking at the latest insider preview, the Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages feature showed up! The New Policy: Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages With one of the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Dev builds (Windows 11 25h2), a new Group Policy setting showed up under: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > App Package Deployment The setting is calledRemove Default Microsoft Store packages from the system. It lets you pick from a curated list of built-in Microsoft Store apps that should be stripped out when a new user profile is created. No, you won\u2019t find Candy Crush or Spotify in there; this is Microsoft\u2019s own inbox app list. Here\u2019s what the UI looks like: Once you enable the policy and select your apps, Windows creates this registry key:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages Each subkey corresponds to a selected app, using its package family name. The Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages Technical Flow: Here\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening under the hood, straight from the code (yes, we decompiled appxalluserstore.dll in IDA.Check out our video on YouTubeto find out more): The logic only runs if bothFeature_RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages(57056100) andFeature_UxAccOptimization(48433719) are enabled. You can enable them using ViVeTool. The feature (GetRemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackagesPolicy) checks the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages policy to determine if the policy is enabled. When a new user profile is created (as opposed to an existing one), the removal logic is triggered. The main function (AddAllUserApplicationsToDynamicArrayForUser) starts enumerating the apps that need to be removed for that user. For each app, the code walks through the subkeys in RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages. If the app matches a subkey and the policy is enabled, it\u2019s flagged for removal. The CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore function is called:Copies the registry data for the app to a \u201cdeleted\u201d subtreeDeletes the provisioning info for that app from the machineMoves the app\u2019s files to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder Copies the registry data for the app to a \u201cdeleted\u201d subtree Deletes the provisioning info for that app from the machine Moves the app\u2019s files to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder If successful, the app is unprovisioned and shouldn\u2019t appear for new users logging in. The logic writes telemetry to theMicrosoft Windows AppXDeploymentServer Operationalevent log. If the policy or removal fails, you\u2019ll see detailed errors there. If you want to follow the process yourself, this all happens in appxalluserstore.dll and is orchestrated (and logged) by the AppXDeploymentServer provider. You can watch events in theMicrosoft Windows AppXDeploymentServer Operationallog. Go Beyond the UI and Remove Any App with PowerShell Right now, the only official option is through Group Policy. But you are not limited to just what the UI shows. As we noticed in the technical flow, Windows only looks for registry subkeys inHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages. If you add a package family name there, even if it is not in the official Group Policy list, Windows will remove that app for every new user profile. Why? Because the code to remove the apps just puts all the packages in one big array!.This gives you much more control. For example, if you want LinkedIn or Copilot removed, just add their package family names to the registry. The removal process will catch anything you list, not just what shows up in the Group Policy window. So, you are also not tied to Group Policy or a CSP. Since this feature is all registry driven, you can set it with a simplePowerShell script Here is what the Script will do. Create a subkey for each package family name you want removed Set a value calledRemovedPackageto 1 in each subkey SetEnabledto 1 at the base key Example: To remove LinkedIn and Copilot, add these: Add the PowerShell to Intune and assign it to all devices to ensure the script runs before the first user signs in, so the app removal occurs at the correct moment. The moment that PowerShell script is executed, the LinkedIn and Copilot app will be removed and will no longer be able to be executed. Bottom line: This approach offers more flexibility than the UI, and you can fully automate it today using PowerShell and Intune, without needing to wait for Microsoft to add CSP or Settings Catalog support. Set your script to run before anyone logs in, and you will achieve precisely the clean deployment you want. Results: Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages I set both feature flags with ViVeTool and enabled the policybeforeAutopilot enrollment. Sure enough, as soon as the device completed provisioning and the first user logged in, the removal ran. You\u2019ll see an event like this in the log (Event ID 327): RemovePackageList Microsoft.QuickAssist_8wekyb3d8bbwe Microsoft.Paint_8wekyb3d8bbwe Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe You get a perfect, machine-readable record of which apps were targeted for removal. Remove Default Microsoft Store PackagesKey requirement:This must all be in place before the first user logs in. It doesn\u2019t seem to do anything for existing profiles\u2026 But\u2026 The Apps Might Still Show Up (Broken) Here\u2019s the catch. Even with the policy and removal process in place, you\u2019ll often see shortcuts for removed apps still lingering in the Start menu or All apps list. Once you click on it nothing happens.. it is just stuck. The good thing? The app indeed is not launching! Event Viewer shows a flood of deployment errors (Event ID 698, AppXDeployment-Server) with error code0x80073D01for the failed apps. So, while the packages are truly unprovisioned, the UI/UX cleanup isn\u2019t finished yet. The Start menu displays \u201cdead\u201d icons, and users are unable to launch the apps. This rough edge just proves: the feature\u2019s backend is there, but the front-end polish isn\u2019t. Is it still in development? What About Intune and Policy CSP? There is a CSP path for this policy:./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/ApplicationManagement/RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages Since it lives under theApplicationManagement node,we\u2019ll likely see a native option to configure it in Intune in the future. However, as of now, the official Microsoft documentation hasn\u2019t been updated, and this setting is not yet available in the Intune Settings Catalog. No need to wait, though.As we showed above, because the policy is fully registry-driven, you can already deploy the exact same configuration using PowerShell and Intune. Just push your PowerShell script as part of Autopilot, and you\u2019ll get the same result as Group Policy, plus the flexibility to target any inbox app. When Microsoft eventually adds CSP and Intune support, you can switch to the native method. Until then, the PowerShell approach gives you all the control you need. How the Microsoft Store App Removal really works (or doesn\u2019t) If you are curious what really happens when this policy is enabled and whether apps are actually removed or just hidden, we took a closer look. It turns out it does not remove anything. Instead, it prevents the apps from being provisioned for new users. Want the technical details, the registry moves, and what is happening behind the scenes? Prevent Store App Provisioning: How it works in Windows 25h2 Summary: This Is the Cleanest Solution\u2026Once It\u2019s Ready If you want to remove default (or other) inbox Microsoft Store apps during provisioning, this new policy is the way to go. It\u2019scurated,only covers Microsoft\u2019s own list, not third-party junk. (But we can change that ourselves) It only works if you enable both feature flags and set the policy before any user signs in. The actual removal is logged in theAppXDeploymentServer Operationallog (Event 327 and errors as 698). It leaves some UI junk behind for now (dead Start menu icons). Still, this is the closest we\u2019ve come to a proper, first-party solution for eliminating bloat before users see it. Final note If you encounter any oddities or the policy doesn\u2019t work as expected, check those feature flags and review your logs. Please note that this is still an Insider-only feature and not yet ready for production. But for anyone tired of wrestling with PowerShell cleanup scripts, this is the most promising thing in years.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/kiosk-devices-win32apps-stuck-waiting/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Kiosk Devices: Win32Apps stuck: Waiting for Install Status This blog will explore a common issue withWin32 app updates on Intune-managed kiosk devices. While these devices are designed for restricted access and often run without an Entra user session, this setup creates a challenge in which Win32 apps initially install finebut fail to update. We\u2019ll explain why this happens, what we found in the logs, and how Microsoft\u2019s suggested workaround failed. Finally, we\u2019ll show you an easy fix you could implement by configuringan Intune configuration profile. This policy will ensure thatyour kiosk devices stay up to date without having to log in with an Entra user on those KIOSK devices. Intune Win32 App \u201cWaiting on Install Status\u201d Kiosk Devices Microsoft recommends using theleast privileged user accountfor kiosk devices, especially inpublic environments where users shouldn\u2019t have system access. To achieve this, kiosk devices typically operate underlocal standard accountsrather than requiring Entra ID logins. These devices are often deployed inshared-use environmentsusingAssigned Access ModeorMulti-App Kiosk Mode. This ensures users can only interact with a predefined set of applications. However, because kiosk devices rely onlocal standard user accounts, application deployments, and updates must functionwithout an Entra user session. WhileWin32 appsinstall successfully during initial provisioning, subsequent updates often fail, getting stuck in a\u201cWaiting for install status\u201dstate indefinitely. Investigation: Following the Logs To get to the root of the issue, we needed to determine why Win32 app updates were stuck and were waiting for the install status. Given that the updates were failing silently, our first step was to check Intune Management Extension (IME) logs, which handle app deployments. SinceIME is responsible for Win32 app execution, we expected to see clues related to installation attempts or authentication failures. From there, we could validate our findings withAAD andAppWorkloadlogsto understand whether the issue wasdevice-based authentication or an Entra ID dependencypreventing updates from being processed. With this in mind, we started digging through the logs IME Logs: Token Acquisition Failures Since updates were failing, we started by checking theIME logs, suspecting a missing device token. Instead, we found repeatedtoken acquisition failures: \u201cFailed to get AAD token. len = 34 using client id \u201c The error suggested that IME was unable to retrieve an Entra ID / AAD Authentication token, meaning it could not validate itself against Intune to process app updates. This initially led us to suspect an issue with device authentication when the Win32App Updates needed to come down to the Kiosk Devices. However, we needed more confirmation. AAD Logs: Authentication Errors To verify whether authentication was the root cause, we checked theAAD logs, where we found: \u201cError: 0x4A50081 at ClientCache.cpp, line 376, method: ClientCache::LoadPrimaryAccount.\u201d These logs confirmed thatauthentication was indeed failing,likely becauseno Entra ID user had ever logged into the device. At this point, we had a clear pattern: IME couldn\u2019t retrieve an Entra ID token. AAD logs showed that no user authentication had occurred. Without a user log in, app updates were stalling indefinitely. But one more piece was missing: what exactly was preventing Intune Management Extension (IME) from moving forward? Kiosk Devices: Device Stuck in Account Setup Next, we checked theAppWorkload logs, which provided another important piece of information. It seems that the device was still in theaccount setup phase, which explains why IME was stalling! The Intune Management Extension (IME) was waiting for a user login to complete the Enrollment Status Page (ESP),which was weird as the device was already provisioned. This behavior means that even though the device itself is fully enrolled in Intune,IME does not move forward with app updatesbecause it is still waiting for the user-specific (Account Setup) phase of ESP to complete. Since kiosk devices do not typically have Entra users logging in, this phase remains incomplete indefinitely, preventing updates from being applied. With it, the Intune Portal will keep waiting for the install status. At this stage, Microsoft recommendsmanually logging inwith an Entra ID account on each device to trigger the update process.While this solution technically worked, it wascompletely impracticalfor large-scale kiosk deployments. This made it pretty clear that a more automated fix was needed. This aligned with findings from our previous research on ESP-related issues, where devices could become stuck in an incomplete state when no Entra user logs in. Feel free to read all the details in ourESP Blog. Fixing the Win32App Update on Kiosk Devices We showed you in theEnrollment Status Page Blogsome time ago that one of the first checks the ESP does is check if the Device and User Status Page is being skipped. If so, the device would return that it isNotInESP, and with it, the Win32App updates would be installed. Once we understood the issue, we applied an easy fix to ensure that Win32 app updates could proceed without requiring an Entra user login. Intune Configuration Profile (OMA-URI Policy) To apply this fix across all affected devices, we deployed anIntune configuration profilewith the following settings: OMA-URI Path:./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/FirstSyncStatus/SkipUserStatusPage Data Type:Boolean Value:true This policy ensured that devices skipped the ESP user phase, allowing Win32 app updates to be installed on Kiosk devices without manual intervention. Of course, we could do the same with a PowerShell command, but using an Intune Configuration Policy is the preferred way to go! Key Findings Through this process, we confirmed: IME and AAD logs both showedtoken acquisition failures, suggesting authentication issues. AppWorkload logs revealed thatthe device was stuck in account setup(awaiting a user login). IME does not process app updates on kiosk devices when an Entra user has not logged in, causing updates to remain in \u201cWaiting for install status.\u201d Microsoft initially suggestedlogging into every device manually with an Entra accountto resolve the issue, which was not a scalable solution. Skipping the ESP user phase using theSkipUserStatusPage CSPallowsWin32 app updates to install without requiring an Entra user session. Final Thoughts This issue is particularly relevant forkiosk and shared-use devices where Entra logins are not feasible. Ensuring that Win32 apps update correctly without user authentication is critical for keeping devices secure and up to date. By skipping the unnecessaryESP user status checkand addressing token failures, we ensured that unattended devices could continue to receive updates as expected. If you\u2019re managingIntune-enrolled kiosk devicesand experiencing similar issues, implementing this fix should allow Win32 app updates to function properly without requiring an Entra user login.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/wsus-is-dead-long-live/", "title": "", "raw_text": "WSUS is Dead! Long Live WSUS! Recently, Microsoft said the inside thing on the outside: they will no longer invest in new features forWindows Server Update Services (WSUS). You can and should read the short blog posthere,which was updated to define deprecation as \u201cwe are no longer investing in new capabilities, nor are we accepting new feature requests for WSUS.\u201d Am I Impacted? The answer to this question naturally follows from the above: Do you have an outstanding feature request for WSUS pending with Microsoft? If you do, then I have good news and bad news. The bad news first: that feature will never \u2026 ever \u2026 see the light of day. The good news: I have an exhilarating,veryexclusive crypto opportunity to offer you called PatchMyCoin\u2122. Get in now before it goes to the moon! If you were one of the fewnotcurrently awaiting, with bated breath, Microsoft\u2019s delivery of amazing new features to WSUS, then you are not impacted. Full stop. You can literally stop reading right now and move on with the rest of your life. Go on; we\u2019ve already got your click; we won\u2019t be offended in the slightest. But WSUSIsDead \u2026 Right? If we measure WSUS\u2019s health by Microsoft\u2019s clarified definition of deprecation, then WSUS hasn\u2019t had a pulse for over a decade. Admittedly, a lack of pulse is not a great look, and WSUS definitely has some structural faults that I\u2019d love to see resolved. Still, if WSUS is working for you today, it shall continue to work for you tomorrow and as far into the future as we in IT can possibly fathom. At a bare minimum, WSUS shall continue to function unabated for atleastten years. How do we come to that conclusion? From the aforementioned blog post: \u201cDeprecated features continue to work and are fully supported until they are officially removed, and we have no current plans of removing WSUS from in-market versions of Windows Server (including Windows Server 2025).\u201d Part of the reason WSUS has not seen significant investment is that shortly after its 3.2 release, it was consumed into Windows Server as an OS feature. All evidence points to that team being uninterested in further developing WSUS beyond life support. However, as an OS feature, Microsoft cannot just arbitrarily End of Life (EoL) it. Given their intent to include it in Server 2025, you can infer aminimumof 10 years of support. It\u2019s also important to remember that the submarine use case is literal, not figurative. Actual, real submarines, full of nuclear missiles, are roaming the seas with more PCs on them than ever before. Those PCs need to be managed, and they are most definitely not talking directly to the internet. It\u2019s an open secret that the DOD requires ten years of advanced notice of any deprecation impacting their operations. When the day comes, and on a long enough timeline, it inevitably will, our industry will have a very long offramp thanks to the US Navy. What Do I Need to Do If I\u2019m Using WSUS? Right now, at this very instant, youneedto do nothing. Absolutely nothing. Microsoft\u2019s decision to deprecate WSUS after over a decade of zero investment is meaningless unless paired with an EoL announcement, which they took great care not to do. There is no reason to take immediate action until Microsoft makes a clear EoL statement and sets an EoL date. Why would Microsoft bother to announce that it won\u2019t be working on WSUS after a decade of not working on WSUS? Microsoft gladly explains itself: \u201cWe recommend organizations transition to cloud tools, including Windows Autopatch and Microsoft Intune for client update management and Azure Update Manager for server update management.\u201d In case you need that translated: \u201cMicrosoft would really like you to adopt the solutions we have built that have found new ways of charging you money.\u201d Microsoft has long pioneered the art of sowing \u2018Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt\u2019 (FUD) to herd customers in the direction Microsoft wants them to move. It\u2019s hard not to interpret an overdue statement of the obvious (no new feature development) without an actual EoL as anything else. It\u2019s working: we\u2019ve already seen system admins and customers reaching out with deep concern that WSUS will stop functioning. Despite the blog itself saying that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. To be clear, you should absolutely review Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings and determine if they better suit your organization\u2019s needs. If they do, you should absolutely start planning a migration path. However, you shouldnotdo so out of fear, uncertainty, or doubt about WSUS working for the foreseeable future. Doesn\u2019t PMPC Rely on WSUS? If you are using PMPC in a Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) environment, then yes,PMPC\u2019s productsintegrate with WSUS to provide updates to existing applications alongside your first-party Microsoft updates. Hopefully, the above has clarified that there is no reason for concern on this front for a long time. If you need reassurance, Microsoft helpfully provides it: \u201cWSUS deprecation does not impact existing capabilities or support for Microsoft Configuration Manager.\u201dSuppose the unthinkable were to happen, however, and MS gets drunk with power and secretly uninstalls WSUS worldwide overnight. In that case, we are committed to ensuring that our ConfigMgr customers retain the ability to install and update third-party applications using our products. We have worked through the various scenarios and have plans of action we would be able to execute quickly to continue delivering the value our customers have come to expect of us.

Please see this updated guide on the improved categories feature withinConfiguration Manager 1910 and newer. As mentioned above,Configuration Manager 1910introduced a new feature to select specific categories for third party updates. This removes the need for one catalog per update. These per-product catalogs described below in the article doNOTsynchronize new updates, and areNOT SUPPORTED. Follow the instructions in the video to use the new features. To better support the upcomingthird-party software update integrationin Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), we are adding the ability to import our catalog per-product. The SCCM third-party software update catalogs feature will publish ALL updates in a catalog with metadata only. We want to give our customers the ability to add our catalog by-product if needed. This feature will allow you to selectively publish products to SCCM, and not have SCCM publish all200+ Products. When you purchase a subscription to our update catalog, you received acatalog URLthat is unique for your subscription. Here\u2019s an example of what a catalog URL looks like If you use the default catalog URL in SCUP or SCCM, you will always have allsupported productsimported into SCUP/SCCM. If you only want to import a product specific, we are adding a new URL parameter namedproductthat can be appended to the catalog URL. The product parameter will tell our server to send you a product-specific CAB file when a valid product is defined. A full list of supported product parameters can be found at the bottom of this post. Here\u2019s an example of the URL you would use to import only Oracle Java updates https://patchmypc.com/scupcatalog/apis/subscriber_download.php?id=12345678901234567890&product=oraclejavaIf using ourautomated publishing service, the product parameterisn\u2019t supported, because the publishing service already selectively publishes products based on the Product Rules. The product parameter was designed to be used in theThird-Party Software Update Catalogsnode inSCCMsince there is no filtering available when SCCM publishes catalogs. The product parameter is supported inCatalogs workspaceofSystem Center Updates Publisher (SCUP).We think it\u2019s less helpful in SCUP since updates are manually selected and published. This parameter can be useful in SCUP if you want to only show specific products in the SCUP console.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/cmg-setup-guide/", "title": "", "raw_text": "A Guide to Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) In today\u2019s digital world, organizations are increasingly managing devices that are not regularly connected to their internal networks. Whether dealing with remote employees, mobile devices, or clients and endpoints operating outside of the traditional boundaries, IT Administrators need a solution that extends the management capabilities beyond the corporate firewall. The Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) provides exactly that: a simple way to manage Configuration Manager clients over the Internet (Cloud Service). In this guide, we will explore what a Cloud Management Gateway is, how it works, and why we should care about this highly effective feature. What is Cloud Management Gateway (CMG)? TheCloud Management Gateway(CMG) feature within Microsoft\u2019s Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) allows organizations to manage client devices over the Internet, eliminating the need for VPNs or a direct connection to the organization\u2019s internal network. Once deployed in Microsoft Azure, it essentially extends your on-premises infrastructure into the cloud without exposing it to the Internet, enabling remote devices to receive updates, patches, and configurations securely and reliably. Through CMG, IT administrators can manage Configuration Manager clients outside the internal network as long as they are connected to the internet, ensuring devices are compliant, secure, and up to date with minimal effort. How Does a Cloud Management Gateway Work? The CMG acts as a middleman, handling client requests and passing them on to the Management Point and Software Update Point (SUP). Clients communicate with the CMG service in Azure, which routes this communication through the CMG Connection Point. This serves as a bridge between the Azure service, the CMG, and your Configuration Manager infrastructure, ensuring seamless connectivity. From there, the CMG Connection Point forwards all requests to your Management Point and SUP. All these components together help your Configuration Manager clients and roaming devices contact your Management Point and SUP. You can visit Microsoft\u2019s Data FlowCMG pagefor more in-depth information. When to Use a Cloud Management Gateway The need for a Cloud Management Gateway has increased dramatically with the rise of remote and hybrid work environments. Here are some scenarios where a CMG can be ideal: If you have an increased number of remote employees, it is important to ensure those remote devices are managed and updated even when they are not connected to the internal network. If you have an increased number of remote employees, it is important to ensure those remote devices are managed and updated even when they are not connected to the internal network. If you manage devices across multiple locations over the internet, using a CMG is more cost-effective than connecting office networks through a Wide Area Network (WAN).

WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) allows IT Administrators toeasily deploy updatesfor Microsoft products to devices in their environment. Admins are provided a console, through which they can choose which updates to approve and which groups of devices to deploy them to. This helps admins ensure that vulnerabilities in their Windows operating systems and, in some cases, 3rd party applications are patched as quickly and efficiently as possible. The functionality provided to admins by WSUS can be extended further by integration with Microsoft Configuration Manager, or PowerShell automation for daily tasks they would otherwise perform manually. Not utilizing a system like WSUS potentially leaves your organization open to threats like malware, or ransomware attacks, which are becoming more and more frequent and can result in data breaches and loss of business. WSUS deployment considerations Before you install and configure WSUS, there are some considerations to think about. Let\u2019s take a high-level look at them. System Requirements The system requirements for WSUS are controlled by the number of devices in your organization that will receive updates from WSUS, so there is no one-size-fits-all guide, but there are some baseline recommendations. These guidelines are from theMicrosoft documentationand assumeup to 30,000 clients are syncing with WSUS every 8 hours. 2Ghz or faster Processor 2Ghz or faster Processor 2GB of RAM above what is required by all other services and software 2GB of RAM above what is required by all other services and software 40GB of disk space or greater 40GB of disk space or greater 1GB network adapter 1GB network adapter Server 2012 or laterNote:Server 2012 and 2012r2 will go end of support on October 10th 2023 Server 2012 or laterNote:Server 2012 and 2012r2 will go end of support on October 10th 2023 Note:Server 2012 and 2012r2 will go end of support on October 10th 2023 Note:Server 2012 and 2012r2 will go end of support on October 10th 2023 Firewall rules To obtain updates from Microsoft Update, the WSUS server uses port 80 for HTTP protocol and port 443 for HTTPS protocol.

There are 2 options when configuring where to store WSUS update content: Locally or on Locally or on Microsoft Update servers. Microsoft Update servers. Local storageis the default option when deploying WSUS, and has the following considerations Network connection between devices and WSUS server Network connection between devices and WSUS server Sufficient disk space20GB minimum, 30GB recommended. Sufficient disk space20GB minimum, 30GB recommended. 20GB minimum, 30GB recommended. 20GB minimum, 30GB recommended. Storing updates locally can be useful if clients are more likely to connect direct to a high-speed corporate LAN, and help reduce bandwidth overheads on your WAN. Remote storageis the alternative to storing updates locally and has its own considerations. Network connection between devices and Microsoft update Network connection between devices and Microsoft update Remote storage becomes beneficial if local storage is at a premium, as the only thing stored locally is update metadata. All content is stored in Microsoft update, which is useful when your devices have a slow WAN connection but a high-speed internet connection. ConfigMgr Integration The requirements and considerations for your WSUS configuration and deployment may differ slightly if you plan to use ConfigMgr to manage your updates on top of WSUS. More information on managing Windows server update services can be found here:Plan for software updates \u2013 Configuration Manager. Summary so far There are multiple ways to deploy and configure WSUS, and the considerations are going to be unique for each environment, so it isn\u2019t my place to tell you how to plan your WSUS configuration. I\u2019ll leave that up to you :). Where I can give you guidance and recommendations is keeping WSUS clean & tidy, making sure it performs optimally and provides a great experience for you and your users. Going forward, we\u2019ll focus on a simple WSUS deployment, with 1 WSUS server, 1 database (we\u2019ll look at some WID and some SQL-related things), and some client devices. I\u2019ll also touch on some of the benefits of using a SUP (Software Update Point) & ConfigMgr on top of WSUS. So let\u2019s take a look at that. Configuring WSUS We\u2019re going to skip over the installation of WSUS, at least for now, but Microsoft has a great 14-step guide on how to install WSUS, which you can find here \u2013Install the WSUS Server role. Before we get into the nitty gritty of tweaking WSUS to run as optimally as possible, let\u2019s take a quick look at the initial configuration of WSUS using the WSUS server configuration wizard as there are some important settings you don\u2019t want to overlook. Choose WSUS upstream server For this example, we\u2019ll stick with syncing from Microsoft Update, but if you were deploying a secondary, or downstream, WSUS server, you may want to sync from another WSUS server in your environment. Specifying a proxy server This is definitely going to be unique to your environment, but if your organization utilizes a proxy server, you will want to enter your proxy server information during this step. Connect to upstream server At this point, WSUS will attempt to connect to the upstream server configured previously to download update information before it can proceed. This can take a few minutes, so be patient \ud83d\ude42 Choose languages This step is the first one where you want to consider your choices. If you only have devices in English, then only download updates in English. If you have devices in multiple languages, select those specific languages. If you select all languages, WSUS will download all the localized packages for every update. e.g. If an update is available in all 38 languages supported by WSUS, it will download that update in all 38 languages. This can impact bandwidth and disk space usage. Choose products Another important step to consider is what products you want to sync updates for. Similarly to the previous step, if you sync all products you\u2019ll probably have a bad time. If you don\u2019t have any Windows 10 devices, don\u2019t sync Windows 10 updates, if you don\u2019t have Windows Server 2003 (Which I hope you don\u2019t), then don\u2019t sync updates for it. Syncing unnecessary products will impact bandwidth and disk space usage. Choose classifications Each update from Microsoft, or 3rd party sources, is defined with an update classification to help organize different types of updates. Here are the available update classifications (taken fromMicrosoft documentation). Critical Updates: Specifies a widely released fix for a specific problem that addresses a critical, non-security-related bug.

For more information about installing this update and other updates for Upgrades, seePrerequisites for software updates. Configure sync schedule If you\u2019re using WSUS on its own, you\u2019ll likely want to configure the schedule to synchronize automatically. However, if you\u2019re using ConfigMgr, or would rather sync manually, you can leave this set to synchronize manually. Finished! This is where you can choose to start your initial synchronization or wait for it to run on its own at the time configured previously. Additionally, you can choose to open the Windows Server Update Services Administration Console as well (It\u2019s greyed out for me as I already have WSUS configured and I\u2019m just rerunning the Windows Server Update Services configuration wizard) Configure auto-approval rules We won\u2019t go through how to configure auto-approval rules, but these let you decide which updates are automatically approved for specific groups, which can save you time by taking away the need to manually approve them every time. Additionally, you can configure how WSUS approves revisions of existing updates, and whether or not to automatically approve updates to WSUS itself. Optimizations! Now that your WSUS server is configured and, hopefully, finished its initial synchronization, let\u2019s take a look at some optimizations that are recommended, but not configured by default. This gets deep, so stay with me just a little longer! Optimizing IIS For some reason, unknown to me, there are recommended changes to your WSUS app pool in IIS that are not configured by default, but they can make a significant increase to your WSUS Server! Patch My PC has a greatarticlethat covers these optimizations as well, but let\u2019s take a look at them! Queue Length 2000 (up from default of 1000)The queue length determines how many HTTP requests can be queued before the service returns 503, Service Unavailable. Doubling this simply increases the number of requests that can be queued.

Idle Time-out (minutes) 0 (down from the default of 20)By default, IIS drops its worker processes after 20 minutes of inactivity. Lowering this inactivity time-out to 0 means resources are freed up quicker.

Private Memory Limit (KB) 0 (unlimited, up from the default of 1,843,200 KB)By default, the WSUS app pool has a private memory limit of 1.8GB and if this limit is reached, it will recycle the app pool.

Every 29 hours the WSUS app pool will recycle itself, by default. Every 29 hours the WSUS app pool will recycle itself, by default. Everything listed above can cause the app pool to recycle over and over again, and whenever the WSUS App Pool recycles, it rebuilds its cache, which can be resource-intensive! Here is a before and after of these changes! Optimizing the SQL server database This one is maybe slightly more involved, and if you have a DBA who maintains your databases you should totally chat with them as well before making any changes! The most recommended and significant optimization is to add 2 non-clustered indexes to your WSUS database, and this applies to both WID (Windows internal database) and SQL server databases. Similar to the IIS optimizations, these are not added by default, but there are a few different ways to add them. Firstly, if you\u2019re using ConfigMgr on top of WSUS, you can enable an option in your Software Update Point that will create these indexes for you \u2013Enable the built-in WSUS maintenance in ConfigMgr 1906 and newer However, as we are talking specifically about a standalone WSUS configuration, let\u2019s look at how to add these manually! Firstly, it\u2019s worth checking whether or not the indexes already exist in your WSUS database. You can do this by running the following query against your WSUS database: If they already exist, great! If not, let\u2019s create them! Creating them is just as simple as checking whether or not they exist, We can use the following query. This is detailed in theMicrosoft documentation. Note: to add missing indexes to WID, SQL server management studio express must be installed locally to run the reindexing script. To connect to WID, please review theMicrosoft Documentation. Once added, it is recommended that you reindex your WSUS database, which again is relatively straightforward to do! Note: to reindex WID, SQL server management studio express must be installed locally to run the reindexing script. To connect to WID, please review theMicrosoft Documentation. The following reindexing script is also provided by Microsoft and is detailed in theirdocumentation. Checking your WSUS Server\u2019s performance As a rough guide to how well your WSUS server is performing, you can run another simple SQL query and measure the performance based on how long that query takes to complete. Provided this query returns in under 30 seconds, this indicates a healthy environment. Anything over 150 seconds suggests potential performance issues with your database. Declining unneeded updates It is recommended not to have more than 1500 superseded & undeclined updates. This can cause both server and client-side performance issues. ConfigMgr can perform a maintenance task based on your supersedence rules to automate this for you. You can read more about supersedence rules in theMicrosoft documentation. However, for WSUS standalone you need to do this either manually, or with PowerShell. To manually decline an update, you simply need to right-click on it in the WSUS console and click Decline, then Yes. However, nobody likes doing things manually, so I definitely recommend going down the PowerShell route to keep on top of declining your superseded updates. Microsoft provide a great script for this, which you can schedule to run periodically or just run it yourself whenever you want to. PowerShell script to decline superseded updates in WSUS This script requires you to specify your WSUS server name, the port to connect on (HTTP or HTTPS), with some option parameters as well. Some examples of how to use this script can be found in the documentation as well. It hopefully goes without saying that you should always test scripts first before running them in a production environment. WSUS cleanup wizard The last thing we\u2019ll look at in the WSUS console is the WSUS cleanup wizard. There are 5 options available there Remove expired and old update revisions Remove expired and old update revisions Delete computers that have not contacted the server in thirty days or more Delete computers that have not contacted the server in thirty days or more Delete unneeded update files Delete unneeded update files Decline updates that are not approved and have been expired by Microsoft Decline updates that are not approved and have been expired by Microsoft Decline superseded updates that meet all of the following criteriaHave not been approved for thirty days or moreAre not currently reported as needed by any clientAre superseded by an approved update Decline superseded updates that meet all of the following criteriaHave not been approved for thirty days or moreAre not currently reported as needed by any clientAre superseded by an approved update Have not been approved for thirty days or more Have not been approved for thirty days or more Are not currently reported as needed by any client Are not currently reported as needed by any client Are superseded by an approved update Are superseded by an approved update Some important notes and warnings from theMicrosoft documentation. Important: In a WSUS hierarchy, it is strongly recommended that you run the cleanup process on the lower-most, downstream/replica WSUS server first, and then move up the hierarchy. The upstream server should be the last one on which the cleanup is run. Warning: Incorrectly running cleanup on any upstream server prior to running cleanup on every downstream server can cause a mismatch between the data that is present in upstream databases and downstream databases. The data mismatch can lead to synchronization failures between the upstream and downstream servers. Important: If you remove unnecessary content by using the Server Cleanup Wizard, all the private update files that you have downloaded from the Microsoft Update Catalog site are also removed. You must reimport these files after you run the Server Cleanup Wizard. If you are using ConfigMgr on top of WSUS, there is an option to instruct ConfigMgr to carry out the removal of obsolete updates from WSUS automatically each time the software update point syncs. If you have never run any sort of cleanup on your WSUS database, you may find that the WSUS cleanup wizard needs to be run a few times to clear up everything, but you may also find that it crashes entirely. If you find that it crashes each time, try running it with 1 option selected at a time. If, even with 1 option selected, it still crashes then the 2 recommendations would be to either Reindex your WSUS database again Reindex your WSUS database again Uninstall and reinstall the WSUS role, scroll back to the start of this blog post, and start from scratch with a fresh databaseThere are obviously things to take into consideration here, for example, all your client devices rescanning against your new WSUS server.

Supported versions A lot of the time WSUS tends to go overlooked, and with it so can whether or not the version that is in use within your organization is still supported by Microsoft. WSUS version supportability goes hand in hand with the version of Windows Server. Summary All of the optimizations we\u2019ve talked about today are worth looking into, but of course can also prove to be time-consuming, especially if you have multiple WSUS servers to check.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remove-default-microsoft-store-apps-just-prevents-provisioning", "title": "", "raw_text": "Remove Default Microsoft Store Apps: Prevents Provisioning for New Users Only This blog will be about what actually happens when you enable the new \u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages\u201d from the System policy designed toprevent Store app provisioningin Windows 11 25H2. Spoiler:the Store apps are not removed. They are just blocked from being provisioned for new users Introduction In the previous blog, we looked at the new\u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages from the System\u201dsetting in Windows 11 25H2. Finally, no more inbox apps automatically appearing during provisioning. No more last-minutePowerShell hacksto debloat the system before the user logs in. But once we dug deeper into what\u2019s actually going on (and tried replicating it ourselves), one thing became clear: It Doesn\u2019t Remove Anything Don\u2019t let the name fool you. This setting does not remove Store apps from the system. It does not uninstall anything, does not clean up disk space, and definitely does not affect the existing user profiles. What it actually does is much simpler: It prevents Windows from provisioning those inbox apps fornew users. That\u2019s it! How the Prevent Store App Provisioning Works. After being poked by Vincent on LinkedIn (asking what really happens), we became intrigued and took another deep dive intoAppxAllUserStore.dll,the component behind the provisioning logic. To do so, we used the IDA tool. If you want to learn more about this,check out our YouTube deep dive Using the IDA tool as we showed in the YouTube video above, we spotted the function: AppxAllUserStore::CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore This function clearly moves package files out of the normal provisioning path. Specifically: App package folders in: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps are moved to: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\DeletedAllUserPackages When looking at the device itself, it indeed showed us the same flow. After the user signed in, all the app store packages were moved to the DeletedAllUserPackages: From there on, the flow also deleted (moved) the corrosponding registry entries in: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications are moved to: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Deleted\\Applications That\u2019s it. No uninstall logic. No real user cleanup. Just preventing the provisioning of the Microsoft Store Apps. We Replicated It Ourselves Just to be sure, we wrote a PowerShell script to do exactly what the function does: Move every folder inside C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder (except the Deleted folder itself) Move each corresponding registry key into a new Deleted subkey It worked. No more provisioning of the Microsoft Store Apps. New users logging in didn\u2019t get the apps. And no errors either. It matched Microsoft\u2019s behavior one-to-one. Existing Users? Good Luck Here\u2019s the catch. If the Microsoft Store app was already provisioned for a user before applying the policy (or our manual script), it still works. That\u2019s because user-scoped apps live in: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages These store apps aren\u2019t touched. So, unless you also clean up the per-user profile data or use AppLocker/WDAC(App Control for Business) to block execution,the app is still fully functional. Why This Matters Because Microsoft called it\u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages from the System.\u201d But let\u2019s be clear: it doesn\u2019t seem to remove anything from the system. It justhides the files and registry keys from the provisioning pathso new users don\u2019t see them. With it, the Store Apps will not be provisioned for new users. Visual Mockup We created a mockup to illustrate this point: the Group Policy screen with the word \u201cRemove\u201d crossed out and replaced with\u201cPrevent from being provisioned.\u201d Because that\u2019s actually happening here. Final Thoughts Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I love this new feature, as it\u2019s quite useful. It\u2019s clean. And it\u2019s way better than racing Intune provisioning with brittlePowerShell scripts to debloat the device. But still necessary for existing users!Read our older blog on how to do so. But it\u2019s not a removal mechanism. It\u2019s aprovisioning blocker. And we only figured this out after: Reverse engineering AppxAllUserStore.dll Reading through the CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore function Testing it ourselves with a manual folder and registry move Watching it behaveexactlylike the policy So, if you\u2019re expecting this to fully strip all Microsoft Store apps from the device, including those used by existing users, you\u2019ll be a bit disappointed. It doesn\u2019t clean. It hides. And that makes all the difference.

The Challenges for Third-Party Patching in Microsoft Intune There is No WSUS in Windows Update for Business (WUfB) Evaluating the Options in Microsoft Intune for Third-Party Updates Creating Third-Party Patches Using Intune Win32 Applications How Third-Party Updates will Work within Patch My PC and Intune Power BI Reports for Microsoft Intune Third-Party Patching Compliance Watch the Short Overview Video: You can watch the short7-minutevideo that reviews the new feature for third-party patching in Microsoft Intune. The Challenges We Encountered Developing Third-Party Patch Management in Microsoft Intune The biggest challenges we faced when coming up with an agentless way to patch third-party applications was thelack of inventoryandupdate flexibilitywhen comparingMicrosoft IntunetoConfiguration Manager (SCCM). We had to rethink the traditional approach to how updates had always worked. With ourpatch-management product for SCCM, we were able to use WSUS which has been evolving forover 20 years. WSUS allowed us to be intentional when creatingdetection rulesanddeploymentsof third-party updates. Here\u2019s an example of a third-party update and the flexibility we have in WSUS to createUpdate Applicability Rules. There is No WSUS in Windows Update for Business (WUfB) Devices managed bystandalone Intunewill scan directly againstWUfB. SinceWUfB is not extensiblelike WSUS for publishing third-party updates, we were unable to use the existing catalog and publishing mechanisms we have been using for Microsoft SCCM and WSUS. WithWUfB, the options are designed to be simplified. Here\u2019s an example of some of the options you receive with WUfB: There isn\u2019t an option forthird-party patchingor the ability for vendors like us topublish third-party updates to WUfBsince it\u2019s primarily Windows Update with additional criteria for targeting for businesses. Evaluating the Options in Microsoft Intune for Third-Party Updates Since our options for patching in Intune were pretty limited compared to WSUS/SCCM, we had to evaluatewhat options were currently available in Microsoft Intune. The good news is third-party patching is ultimately just updating binaries on a device using an installer file (MSI, EXE, or MSP). AtMicrosoft Ignite 2018,Brad Andersondid announce a new feature in Microsoft Intune forWin32 application management. The Win32 application management feature added the ability to deployEXE-basedinstallers and gave more options for deploymentMSI-basedinstallers. We have been using the Win32 application feature in Intune sinceFebruary 2020, when we released our feature toautomatically create applicationsfor Microsoft Intune. This feature allows us to automatically create applications in Intune that you can deploy as required to users or make available incompany portal. While this was a great start, this only helped our customers to deploy third-party applications in Intune. Still, itdidn\u2019t address how to patch and report on existing third-party applicationsinstalls on managed devices. Creating Third-Party Patches Using Intune Win32 Applications We wanted toavoidinstalling anyadditional agentsfor third-party patching in Intune, so we had to develop a solution to make Win32 applicationsfunction more like a software update. The main challenge here was ensuring we have the ability only to install the Win32 application when there\u2019s only anoutdated version of the product already installed. Intune already offered an option for applicationrequirementsthat need to be met for an application to be consideredapplicable. We were able to create a check within therequirement rulesand make them function likeinstallable rulesin the traditional update model within WSUS. How Third-Party Updates will Work within Patch My PC and Intune The way we are implementing third-party patching in Microsoft Intune is to havetwo separate Win32 applicationsfor each product. One of the Win32 applications will be designed forinitial deployments. Theupdate versionof the Win32 application will be designed only to be required whenan outdated version is detected. If you review theupdate versionof the Win32 application, you will be able to see the compliance statistics. When an update is deployed as required, if there isn\u2019t an older version installed, the Win32 application will show asNot Applicable. In the device or user install status blade, you will seePowerShell script requirement rule is not metin the Status Details column. By configuring the Win32 applications withrequirements, we were able to create athird-party software update experiencevery similar toSCCM. Here\u2019s an example of how a Win32 application update will reportcompliance statesand how it compares to software updates in SCCM.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/oobecompletetimestamp-hotpatch-delay/", "title": "", "raw_text": "OOBECompleteTimestamp: The Hidden Reason Behind WUfB Hotpatch Delays If you\u2019ve read my previous post aboutWindows 11 Hotpatch, you\u2019ll remember how this feature promises rebootless updates and streamlined patch management. But during that deep dive, one question lingered: why wasn\u2019t the Windows 11 Hotpatch policy applied right after enrollment? The answer lies with an important registry key inside the Windows Update process: the OOBE Complete Time Stamp (OOBECompleteTimestamp). This blog unpacks what this registry key does, why it\u2019s so critical for Windows Update for Business (WUfB) policies, and how it can create delays or failures. Bonus tip: We\u2019ll explore how this key might also help requirement scripts determine whether the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) is truly complete. Introduction: From Enrollment to Updates: The Hidden Puzzle Piece So, there you are, setting up a new Windows device. The Windows Autopilot enrollment finishes, and everything seems fine\u2026 until you realize some updates aren\u2019t kicking in as expected.Windows Hotpatch?Delayed. Rebootless updates? Nowhere to be seen. If this sounds familiar, the answer might lie in a little-known registry key calledOOBECompleteTimestamp. This blog explores what this key does, why it\u2019s critical for policies like the Hotpatch setting, and how its absence and even its presence (with delays) can complicate yourWUfB policies.We\u2019ll also cover Microsoft\u2019s fixes to ensure updates flow smoothly during and after enrollment. Let\u2019s dive in. The Discovery: What is OOBECompleteTimestamp? During the Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE) and when the user signs in for the first time, the system processes configurations, applies policies, and prepares the device for life in the real world. Once this process is done,winlogon.exewrites a registry key namedOOBE Complete Time stamp. This key serves as the device\u2019s marker that OOBE has officially ended. Here\u2019s where you can find it: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE\\OOBECompleteTimestamp It looks like this: Name:OOBECompleteTimestamp Type: Binary Value: A timestamp marking the exact moment OOBE wrapped up. Let\u2019s discuss some fun facts about this key. Fun fact number one: With that OOBECompleteTimeStamp key missing, theAllowRebootlessUpdatespolicy won\u2019t kick in. We will spot the same when taking a look at the UpdateStore Database. The last run was blocked by OOBE(BlockedByOObe) Fun fact number two: Even with this key set,Windows Update for Business (WUfB)policies like re-bootless updates or hot patching might not apply immediately. Let\u2019s first zoom in on how that \u201cdelay exactly works.\u201d OOBE Completion and First Use Time: When is a Device Ready? Windows doesn\u2019t just mark the end of the OOBE phase with the OOBECompleteTimestamp, and it also uses this key to calculate when a device is officially\u201cready.\u201d This readiness is determined by a process calledFirst Use Time, which depends entirely on OOBE completion. Here\u2019s what happens under the hood: OOBE Check:The system verifies if OOBE has completed using the OOBEComplete function. If not, the \u201cfirst use time\u201d defaults to an invalid state, preventing updates or policies from applying. OOBE Check:The system verifies if OOBE has completed using the OOBEComplete function. If not, the \u201cfirst use time\u201d defaults to an invalid state, preventing updates or policies from applying. System Setup Manager:If OOBE is complete, the system retrieves the timestamp via theGetOutOfBoxExperienceCompleteTimemethod from SystemSetupManager. System Setup Manager:If OOBE is complete, the system retrieves the timestamp via theGetOutOfBoxExperienceCompleteTimemethod from SystemSetupManager. Conversion:The retrieved timestamp is converted from Windows file time to Unix epoch time, making it usable for updates and policies. Conversion:The retrieved timestamp is converted from Windows file time to Unix epoch time, making it usable for updates and policies. Error Handling:If errors occur or the OOBE timestamp is invalid, the system halts further calculations, potentially delaying updates or compliance policies. Error Handling:If errors occur or the OOBE timestamp is invalid, the system halts further calculations, potentially delaying updates or compliance policies. The Delayed Readiness Dilemma: When Hotpatching Hits Pause Even when theOOBECompleteTimestampis correctly set, the system doesn\u2019t jump to action. Instead, it takes a sweet time to request or apply policies likeHotpatch/AllowRebootlessUpdates. This delay isn\u2019t a bug; it\u2019s a feature. It\u2019s designed to ensure the system is fully prepared before Windows updates and policies start rolling out. But here\u2019s the rub: this deliberate delay often leaves IT administrators scratching their heads, wondering why their freshly enrolled devices seem stuck in limbo, missing Windows updates or policies they expected to be applied instantly. Now, when theOOBECompleteTimestampis missing or invalid, things really take a turn for the worse. The Problem: Missing the OOBE Complete Timestamp Without this critical marker, the system can\u2019t calculate\u201cFirst Use Time\u201d, and that\u2019s where the trouble begins. No timestamp, No Update, No Policies? Devices are left hanging in an unready state, leaving admins scrambling to figure out what went wrong. This isn\u2019t just a rare edge case. Newly enrolled devices sometimes lack theOOBECompleteTimestampimmediately after enrollment. Why? Because if theOOBEprocess gets interrupted or doesn\u2019t complete properly,winlogon.exewon\u2019t create the key at all. And without this key: Windows Updatessit idle, waiting indefinitely for the green light that never comes. Windows Updatessit idle, waiting indefinitely for the green light that never comes. Policies likeHotpatchingand other WUfB features stay on hold, and they are refusing to apply. Policies likeHotpatchingand other WUfB features stay on hold, and they are refusing to apply. IT admins are left chasing ghosts, trying to debug devices that won\u2019t cooperate. IT admins are left chasing ghosts, trying to debug devices that won\u2019t cooperate. Whether it\u2019s the deliberate delay after the key is set or the chaos caused by its absence, theOOBECompleteTimestampcan be a silent saboteur in your update strategy. Knowing how to spot these issues and fix them is the key to keeping your devices up to date without the drama. How to Verify the OOBECompleteTimestamp Before discussing fixes, let\u2019s confirm if the issue is with this key. A quick PowerShell command will tell you if the OOBECompleteTimestamp is missing or set incorrectly. Here\u2019s the script to check the timestamp and translate it into a readable format: Run this script, and you\u2019ll either see the exact time OOBE is completed or confirmation that the key doesn\u2019t exist. So, people who want to determine if the OOBE is complete can just check if this key is there! Easy does it! The Fix: Enabling Updates Before the First Sign-In If the OOBECompleteTimestamp is missing or you\u2019re running into update delays, Microsoft has introduced apolicy fixto address this. You can configureAllow updates to install before initial user sign-into bypass the reliance on OOBECompleteTimestamp. This ensures updates are processed regardless of the OOBE state. $RegKeyPath = \u201cHKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WindowsUpdate\\Orchestrator\u201d $regValueName = \u201cScanBeforeInitialLogonAllowed\u201d $regValueData = 1 New-Item -Path $RegKeyPath -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null New-ItemProperty -Path $RegKeyPath -Name $regValueName -Value $regValueData -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null For reference, check out Microsoft\u2019s official guidancehere. Why Does This Fix Matter? By enabling updates before sign-in, you\u2019re essentially cutting out the dependency on OOBECompleteTimestamp. This is especially useful for: Newly enrolled devices: Ensures updates happen without delays, even if the key isn\u2019t created in time. Newly enrolled devices: Ensures updates happen without delays, even if the key isn\u2019t created in time. Enterprise environments: Keeps devices compliant with update policies right out of the box. Enterprise environments: Keeps devices compliant with update policies right out of the box. Hotpatch workflows: Prevents rebootless updates from stalling due to missing markers. Hotpatch workflows: Prevents rebootless updates from stalling due to missing markers. Wrapping Up: OOBE, Policies, and the Waiting Game TheOOBECompleteTimestampmight seem like a minor detail, but it\u2019s the linchpin that tells Windows it\u2019s time to roll out updates and apply policies. Without it, or with delays in processing, it\u2019s like hitting the brakes on Hotpatching, and other WUfB features. You can sidestep these delays and keep your devices running smoothly by staying ahead of this potential bottleneck, verifying the timestamp, and implementing the fix. Next time updates stall or policies fail to apply, you\u2019ll know exactly where to dig.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/bitlocker-recovery-key-cleanup/", "title": "", "raw_text": "BitLocker Stale Recovery Key Cleanup: No More Silent Encryption Failures It\u2019s well known that Microsoft Entra ID supports a maximum of 200 BitLocker recovery keys per device. Once this limit is reached,new recovery keys cannot be escrowed to Entra. Silent encryption will failif the BitLocker policy enforces key escrow before enabling encryption. Since BitLocker requires a successful backup of the recovery key before proceeding, encryption does not start, leaving the deviceunencrypteduntil we remove the device object from Entra\u2026. which is a horrible fix. This blog will show you what is coming and how Microsoft is going to fix this weird BItlocker Issue! The Old Way: A Broken Process When looking back at the old days, the moment your device hit the 200-BitLocker Recovery key limit, your options were pretty limited. The only way to fix it was to: Delete the entire device record from Entra, wipe out all recovery keys, and force a full, clean install of the device. Disable silent encryption. The moment you turn on encryption, you need to manually extract/save the recovery key to a nice PDF. Neither option was practical or scalable. The fact that this issue existed for over five years without a proper solution made it even worse. But then, while analyzing changes in a recent Windows Insider Preview build, we stumbled upon something interesting. As shown below, we noticed something called:Cleanup AAD Stale RPs for Max Limit. We had to look closer; this felt like the fix we were all waiting for! How We Discovered the Bitlocker Recovery Key Fix I started looking at multiple DLL files when I spotted that new feature. It was obvious that I first tried to open the fveapi.dll and the bdesvc.dll, but neither of them showed me traces of that new feature. When opening Procmon and manually escrowing the recovery key to Entra, I stumbled upon the file called fveskybackup.dll. Inside thisfveskybackup.dll, we indeed found new functions related to BitLocker recovery password cleanup. UsingIDA Pro, we identified a key function: Feature Flag: BitLocker Cleanup for AAD Stale Recovery Passwords WilFeatureTraits_Feature_BitLocker_Cleanup_AAD_Stale_RPs_For_Max_Limit This function retrieves the cached feature state and determines if the cleanup behavior should be enabled. In other words,Windows now has an internal feature flag that controls the automatic deletion of stale BitLocker recovery passwords in Entra when the 200-key limit is hit. This confirms that Microsoft has built a toggleable mechanism for this feature, which explains why it wasn\u2019t previously available. How BitLocker Normally Uploads Recovery Keys to Entra Before we discuss the new cleanup function, let\u2019s first understand howBitLockeruploads recovery keys. When BitLocker encryption is enabled with silent encryption, the recovery key is automatically backed up to Entra. Here\u2019s what normally happens under the hood: Pretty simple, right? If the policy enforces the key to be uploaded to Entra, FVESkyBackup start doing its job\u2026 but looking back at the escrow issue. If the device has fewer than 200 recovery passwords stored, the upload succeeds. If the device has fewer than 200 recovery passwords stored, the upload succeeds. If the device already has 200 recovery passwords stored, the upload fails\u2014breaking silent encryption. If the device already has 200 recovery passwords stored, the upload fails\u2014breaking silent encryption. And that\u2019s where everything went wrong in the past. But this new function changes that. What We Found in fveskybackup.dll Looking inside fveskybackup.dll, we discovered two critical functions: FveCleanupStaleRecoveryPasswordsInAADIdentifies stale recovery passwords.Decides which ones should be deleted. Identifies stale recovery passwords. Decides which ones should be deleted. FveDeleteRecoveryPasswordsFromCloudDomainExecutes the deletion of stale recovery passwords in Entra.Removes16 passwords per batch. Executes the deletion of stale recovery passwords in Entra. Removes16 passwords per batch. These discoveries suggested that Windows now automatically cleans up stale recovery keys when the upload fails. Before I started analyzing the code, I decided to test if my eyes weren\u2019t playing jokes on me. Rotating The Bitlocker Keys! To see this Bitlocker Recovery Key Stale Cleanup feature in action, we wrote a PowerShell script that: Removed the BitLocker recovery Key. Uploaded the new Bitlocker Recovery key to Entra. Repeated this process until we hit the 200 Bitlocker Recovery keys. While this script was running, we kept an eye out for the Recovery Keys in Intune. Within about 10 minutes, we had 200 Recovery Keys escrowed\u2026 nice right? In older Windows builds, this would cause silent encryption to fail completely. But in this Insider Preview build, something different happened. Stale Bitlocker Recovery Key Cleanup Kicking in When Entra reached the maximum of 200 Bitlocker Recovery keys, something funny started happening. If the escrow hits the 200-key limit, it will fail to save BitLocker drive encryption information to your Azure Ad due to an error. As shown above and below, the recovery key failed to be saved to Azure Ad because the maximum number of recovery passwords for this device has already been saved. Exactly at this moment, some magic started to happen! The new Bitlocker Key cleanup function was automatically triggered when it reached the maximum number of saved recovery passwords (Bitlocker Recovery Keys). When this Stale Cleanup function is triggered, it will contact the service again, this time asking which stale Bitlocker Recovery keys exist. Once it determines which stale Bitlocker Recovery Keys are still lingering at the service, it will ask the service to start deleting old recovery passwords. From what I can tell, every time it cleans up state recovery passwords, it will clean up exactly 16 entries. We can spot the same behavior when looking at Fiddler: As shown above, it will send anHTTP DELETE requestto the Microsoft Enterprise Registration endpoint (enterpriseregistration.windows.net), to remove stale BitLocker recovery passwords (KIDS) stored inMicrosoft Entra ID. Once enough stale Bitlocker recovery passwords were cleared, the new Bitlocker key upload process was retried, but this time, it succeeded. This confirmed that the cleanup process was now fully automated, and if we are even more patient, we will spot some automatic cleanup for the rest of the stale Bitlocker Recovery Keys. As shown below, the Bitlocker-Api Management event log showed me that it deleted all stale Bitlocker keys in a batch of 16. This is pretty amazing if you ask me, but I am not done yet! Cleanup Stale Bitlocker Keys ETL trace It was obvious that I also ensured I was running anETL tracewhile trying to break the escrow again. As I mentioned in a previous blog, you need to know what to capture when you want to run an ETL trace. As shown above, I made sure to add thefveenableloggingproviderto the ETL trace, as that one contained the fveskybackup.dll. Looking at the flow, we indeed spot the same behavior. It will try to perform the FveSkybackup cloud backup. The moment it reaches the 200 limit, it will error out. From there, the Cleanup Stale RP in AAD function will be launched! This feature will delete 16 stale BitLocker keys, and then the escrow can happen again! The Cleanup AAD Stale RP Mermaid Flow With all this information gathered, I reopened the IDA Tool and started to work out the flow. As shown below, this is what will happen when thisBitLocker_Cleanup_AAD_Stale_RPs_For_Max_Limitfeature is enabled!! Summary of the Bitlocker Cleanup BitLocker tries to upload a new recovery keyto Entra. If the200-key limit is reached, the uploadfails. If the cleanup feature is enabled,Windows retrieves and compares recovery passwords. Stale passwords are queued and deleted in batches(16 per batch). After deletion, the recovery key upload isretried. If successful,backup is completed. If not, an error is returned. This means Windows nowintelligently removes older recovery passwordswhen necessary, allowing silent encryption to continue working without manual intervention. This got me wondering\u2026 what If I would use PowerShell to try to Manually Retrieving and Deleting BitLocker Recovery Keys: I was curious if we could somehow manually trigger the same cleanup process using PowerShell on the device itself. Why? well for starters, there is no Delete Graph command\u2026 which made me even more curious. But then again, If Windows could delete stale Bitlocker recovery keys in Entra, could we do it, too? Time to find out. Step 1: Retrieving BitLocker Recovery Keys Our first attempt was simple: send a request toretrieve all BitLocker recovery keysstored in Entra ID for a test device. However, things didn\u2019t go as planned. Instead of getting a list of keys, we ran into this error: \u201cThe request failed with status Unauthorized (401). Method requires client TLS but the client did not provide one.\u201d This made it clear thatWindows doesn\u2019t just send a normal API request; it requires a specific client TLS certificatefor authentication. Digging deeper, we checked how Windows normally communicates with Entra ID for BitLocker operations. I guess that one is pretty obvious\u2026 The Entra certificate labeled\u201cMS-Organization-Access\u201d is usedto authenticate these API requests. After locating this certificate in the local machine\u2019s certificate store (using the thumbprint), we attached it to our request and tried again. And it worked.This time, instead of a NOT AUTHORIZED error, we got back afull list of stored BitLocker recovery keysfor the device, each with a unique identifier (kid). Now that we had successfully retrieved the stored stale Entra Bitlocker keys, the next logical step was todelete them allwith a script. So, instead of a GET we added aDELETE. We formatted the request, as shown above, to remove all of them at once, but Windows had another restriction in place: During this PowerShell web request to delete all of the stale Bitlocker Recovery keys, we also had Fiddler open and running. Looking at the response, it was pretty obvious that we were only allowed to delete 16 keys. This aligned perfectly with theautomatic cleanup function we discovered earlier, which also removes keys in batches of 16. So, if you want to delete them, you need to do it in batches of 16 from the device itself! Final Thoughts For years, hitting the200-key limit in Entra meant silent encryption would break, forcing admins to delete entire device records or disable automatic backups. It was amessy, inefficient processwith no proper fix, until now. With this new cleanup mechanism in theInsider Preview build, Windows can finally remove stale recovery passwordsautomatically instead of blocking new backups. If this feature makes it togeneral availability, it will eliminate the need for manual intervention and makeBitLocker silent encryption far more reliable. Key Takeaways Windows now has a built-in cleanup function for stale recovery keys in Entra. It deletes 16 recovery passwords per batch when the 200-key limit is reached. This feature is controlled via an internal feature flag (Feature_BitLocker_Cleanup_AAD_Stale_RPs_For_Max_Limit). If it reaches GA, IT admins will finally have an automated way to keep BitLocker working without manual cleanup. I am very happy to see that,Microsoft fixed one of the biggest BitLocker headaches with this feature!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/intune-settings-catalog-error-code-65000/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Settings Catalog: Error Code 65000 This blog examinesError code 65000when deployingSettings Catalog policies in Intune, specifically forADMX-backed policies. Normally, Intune delivers the required ADMX template viaADMXInstall CSP, allowing policies to be configured. However, multiple organizations onEurope 0301 (ASU)reported policies failing withError 65000, and no trace ofADMXInstallin SyncML logs. This led to an investigation intomissing policy commands, registry keys, and an issue beyond the admin\u2019s control. The 65000 Error Code It all started with a simple message. \u201cHey, do you know why our ADMX-backed OneDrive Policies aren\u2019t applying?\u201d It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that question. Policies failing to apply in Microsoft Intune isn\u2019t exactly groundbreaking news. It happens. Maybe the device hadn\u2019t synced properly, maybe there was a bad configuration, or maybe the user forgot to reboot. But then, another company reached out.Then another.Then another. By the time the fourth company reported the same issue, it was obvious this wasn\u2019t some random delay. Something waswrong. But what? Devices were syncing with Intune, but policies weren\u2019t applying No sign of ADMXInstall in SyncML logs Error 65000 across all affected devices And one very specific pattern: every single affected tenant was on the Europe 0301 azure scale unit That couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Step One: How ADMX Policies Are Supposed to Apply Before diving into troubleshooting, confirming how things were supposed to work made sense. ADMX-backed policies follow a different process than standard MDM policies. Instead of interacting directly with thePolicy CSP,OMADMClient.exe calls PolicyManager.dll, which handles ADMX ingestion and policy delivery. Expected Flow of ADMX Policies You configured the ADMX backed Edge/OneDrive policy in Intune and assign the policy to your devices You configured the ADMX backed Edge/OneDrive policy in Intune and assign the policy to your devices The moment the device checks in the MDMclient(OMADMClient.exe) syncs the policyand hands it off the power to PolicyManager.dll. The moment the device checks in the MDMclient(OMADMClient.exe) syncs the policyand hands it off the power to PolicyManager.dll. If the ADMX template is missing, the ADMXInstall CSP with the ADMX will be sent to the device. From there on the PolicyManager.dll triggers theVerify ADMX Policies Are not Set and IngestAdmxTextBlob functions,which downloads and registers the ADMX If the ADMX template is missing, the ADMXInstall CSP with the ADMX will be sent to the device. From there on the PolicyManager.dll triggers theVerify ADMX Policies Are not Set and IngestAdmxTextBlob functions,which downloads and registers the ADMX Aregistry entry is createdin: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MicrosoftPolicyManagerAdmxInstalled ADMX files are stored in: C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftPolicyManagerADMXIngestion Once the ADMX template is in place,Intune applies the policy settings(sometimes it happens in the wrond way around and with it also causing the error code 65000) At this point, the policies should appear in: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies and the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\PolicyManager This is whereEdge settings, OneDrive policies, and any other ADMX-backed configurationsshould be enforced. But on affected devices, none of this was happening. The ADMX Flow. The corresponding flow to the stuff above\u2026. Step Two: The 65000 Error. What It Actually Means Before investigating further, it was worth looking atwhat Error 65000 actually tells us. In a previous deep dive (65000 Error 0x82b00006 \u2013 Settings Catalog), we explained howthis error does not indicate a specific failure. Instead, it is ageneric responsewhen the MDM client cannot process a policy correctly. Why Does 65000 Happen? The policy is misconfigured The required ADMX template is missing Intune is sending an unsupported setting An issue in Intune\u2019s backend prevents delivery The policy is first delivered before the ADMX In other words: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do with this policy, so here\u2019s a nice 65000 error for you.\u201d So\u2026.What if Intune never sent the ADMX template?What happens then? Step Three: The Missing ADMXInstall CSP If Intune was correctly deploying ADMX-backed policies, the SyncML tool should show us the admxinstall CSP dropping down to the device. That command tells the deviceto ingest the ADMX template before applying policy settings. After pulling theMDMlogs from the Intune Portalwe noticed that on every affected device,the admx itself was missing. In a working environment the logs should have included something like this: There was no reference to the ADMX ingestion at all, only the event logs in which it is mentioned that the system cannot find the file specified for the corresponding ADMX policies The devices weren\u2019t only failing to apply policies, but they were never receiving the instruction to install the ADMX template in the first place. With it the ADMX files and the corresponding PolicyManager registry key weren\u2019t created! So now what? We had ruled out: Misconfiguration\u2013 policies were assigned correctly Sync issues\u2013 devices were successfully communicating with Intune Device-specific problems\u2013 all affected tenants were on EU 0301 What do you even troubleshoot when there\u2019s nothing left to check? At this point, there wasno workaround. Nothing we could modify, reset, or adjust on the devices themselves. So, where does that leave us? Step Four: Reaching Out to Microsoft about the 65000 error With no leads left, we reached out toMicrosoft \u201csupport\u201dto ask: \u201cAre there any known issues affecting ADMX policy delivery ?\u201d After having a funny, long conversation, things started to become clear. It wasnot just us.Other organizations were seeing the same issue. While talking with Microsoft support, they asked us to look at the Health Service. Step Five: What Was Happening at the Service Level? There it was. The Service Health Message above is telling us: New or updated Administrative Templates policies may not be delivered to users\u2019 devices.Status:Service degradationScope:Admins in theNorthern Europe regionRoot cause:A backlog of ADMX policies was not being processed efficiently, resulting in a delay in delivering policies to devices. That explained everything. This was not async issue, amisconfiguration, or anIntune bug. It wasMicrosoft\u2019s backend, and companies on theEU 0301ASU were stuck waiting for policies to be processed. There was nothing anyone could do but wait. Step Six: The Moment It \u201cFixed Itself\u201d And then, hours later, it happened. One message after another. \u201cSurprise surprise, ADMX is working now. I just ran a sync, and they came through.\u201d No policies were modified. No configurations were adjusted. Microsoftcleared the backlogand suddenly, everything started working. A final check confirmed it: SyncML logs now showed ADMXInstall Event Viewer confirmed MDM PolicyManager: ADMX Ingestion was processing Registry keys were created, and policies were finally applied Just like that, the problem was gone. Whoooop!! Final Thoughts: When ADMX Policies Disappear, Look Upstream This case was a perfect example of how policy failures can look like a device issue when they are actually a backend infrastructure problem. IfADMX-backed policies are not applying, do not just check the device. Instead: Check SyncML logs\u2192 If ADMXInstall is missing, the device never received the command Check Event Viewer logs\u2192 If MDM PolicyManager: ADMX Ingestion is not there, ingestion never even started Check the Microsoft Service Health Dashboard\u2192 If there is a backlog,you will not be able to fix it manually Because sometimes, it is not your policy; it is just stuck in a queue that only Microsoft can clear.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/zero-day-vulnerabilities/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Zero-Day Vulnerabilities \u2013 The Invisible Threat Somewhere in the world right now, a person is gaining internet access for the first time. To most of these new users the internet is a place for social media, education, and entertainment. To others, it is a way to make money, and some of the methods they use to gain their fortunes require hacking and exploitation. With over half the Earth\u2019s population now having internet access, this means that these malicious actors are not rare, and they are only getting smarter and more advanced. That is why it is more important than ever that organizations take cybersecurity seriously. So, let\u2019s say youdotake it seriously. You have multi-factor authentication (MFA) set up on your company accounts; you\u2019re vetting your suppliers cautiously; you\u2019re militant about annual security training for all employees (even the janitor!). What could go wrong? Well, in the words of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, \u201cIt is possible to do everything right and still lose\u201d. This is where zero-day vulnerabilities come in. What is a Zero-Day Vulnerability? Azero-day vulnerabilityis an unknown flaw in released software or hardware. Since the hardware or software vendor are not aware of thesesecurity vulnerabilities, they end up shipping the product to customers with easily exploitable issues attached. These are called zero-day vulnerabilities (or, simply, \u201czero-days\u201d) because there are zero days of protection or warning for users once the vulnerability is discovered. These are especially dangerous because zero-days are specifically sought out by malicious actors: it allows them to access as many systems as possible to collect sensitive company information to sell, and potentially hold ransom for large amounts of money. Are They Different from Zero-Day Exploits and Zero-Day Attacks? Zero-day vulnerabilities, exploits, and attacks are related terms, but they refer to different aspects of the same concept. While a zero-day vulnerability is the flaw itself, azero-day exploitis what cybercriminals develop in order to target those software or hardware vulnerabilities. Examples of exploits would be using malicious code, attack techniques, and backdoors to exploit vulnerabilities, all of which give the malicious actor unauthorized access to systems so they can steal data or carry out other malicious actions. Then comes thezero-day attackwhere the criminals use the zero-day exploits to target vulnerable systems and networks. These attacks are incredibly challenging to defend against; since the vendor was unaware of the vulnerability, they have no patches to deploy to help protect customer organizations. Until the vendor resolves the product flaw, the organization is left vulnerable to such exploits. To summarize: a zero-day vulnerability is a hidden weakness in software or hardware, a zero-day exploit is the code or technique used to take advantage of that vulnerability, and a zero-day attack is the actual act of exploiting the vulnerability in real-world attacks. Essentially, if a zero-day vulnerability is a wound, the exploit is the bacteria, and the attack is the resulting infection (gross, huh?). Who Carries Out Zero-Day Attacks? So, who is conducting these attacks? While they are all criminals, there are many different types of criminals that will conduct zero-day attacks for varying reasons. The first group iscybercriminals. Cybercriminalscan be individualsor a part of criminal organizations, and they use zero-day exploits to compromise systems and steal valuable data for financial gain. They may use the information they obtain for identity theft, selling on the dark web, or any number of other malicious purposes. There are also government-sponsored hacking groups callednation-state actorsoradvanced persistent threats (APT).APTs may use zero-day exploits to conduct cyber espionage, sabotage, or other forms of cyberattacks in pursuit of political, military, or economic objectives. Another type of criminal to look out for arehacktivists. A famous example of a hacktivist group would beAnonymous, but hacktivists can also be individuals. These are hackers with an agenda: they usehacking as a means to promote social or political causes. They may employ zero-day exploits to disrupt services, deface websites, or steal sensitive information from organizations they perceive to be against their cause. Lastly, there are regular ol\u2019criminal hackers.These are people or groups with the goal to cause harm to organizations or individuals for personal gain, which could be anything from money to infamy to just an ego boost. Those without a purpose use zero-day exploits just to show that they can, which makes them extra threatening. These may be the major groups that engage in zero-day attacks, but it is important to remember that they are not always coming from outside your organization.Insider threatsare also a possibility, as they can fall under any of these categoriesandhave easier access to your systems. Without appropriate safeguards against both inside and outside threats, you are always at higher risk of a cyber-attack. Who Are the Targets for Zero-Day Attacks? Anyone can become a target for a zero-day attack so long as they have software vulnerability in their system. Large corporationsmay be targeted by cybercriminals and nation-state actors to steal intellectual property, financial data, customer information, and other confidential data, while smaller enterprises are also targeted often due to having less security measures in place. This could easily lead to asupply chain attack,which is where attackers compromise suppliers and service providers as a way to gain access to larger organizations that rely on their services. Government organizationsare also a massive target. Nation-state actors frequently target government agencies to access sensitive information, carry out cyber espionage, or disrupt critical infrastructure. Thiscritical infrastructureincludes sectors such as energy, water, transportation, andeducation; disrupting these essential services has a widespread effect and harms the general public. Another critical sector that often comes under attack is thehealthcare system. The healthcare sector is vulnerable to attacks due to the value of patient data and the lack of emphasis on cybersecurity, which is why healthcare organizations are especially susceptible toransomware attacks. Although these are major targets, we\u2019ve seen plenty of other sectors also fall prey to targeted attacks: financial institutions,non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and even manufacturing industries \u2013 such as theColonial pipeline\u2013 have come under attack in recent years. How Do Zero-Day Attacks Negatively Impact Businesses? The effects of a zero-day attack are vast, regardless of sector or organization size. Zero-day attacks can lead to significantfinancial lossesfor businesses. Attackers may steal sensitive financial data, initiate fraudulent transactions, or demand hefty ransoms in exchange for the organization\u2019s systems and information. This can disrupt business operations by rendering critical systems and services unavailable. Not only can this downtime have a significant impact on productivity and revenue, but the costs associated with investigating the breach, recovering data, and implementing security measures can be substantial. Along with the initial recovery costs, there arelegal consequencesandreputational damageto consider. Many countries have data protection and privacy laws that require organizations to safeguard customer and employee data. A zero-day attack that exposes sensitive data can lead to legal consequences, fines, and regulatory sanctions if the affected organization is found to be non-compliant. This process can severely damage a company\u2019s reputation and erode customer trust, since no one wants to do business with an organization that cannot protect their data. In order to recover from thi there is also the time and money that must be spent onimproving cybersecurity measuresto prevent future breaches. This includes the development and implementation of stronger security protocols, the acquisition of advanced security tools, and ongoing security monitoring. All of this is to say that the effects of a zero-day attack can extend well beyond the initial incident and cause an incredible amount of damage to both the company and the customers. How Do You Identify Zero-Day Attacks? After all this, you may be wondering how to identify if your organization has been compromised in such attacks. This is whereantivirus softwareandnetwork and endpoint monitoringcome in. Utilizing network monitoring tools to scrutinize network traffic for unusual or suspicious patterns, such as unexpected data flows, unusual connection attempts, or spikes in traffic to certain ports, is the best way to catch a zero-day attack in the works. Another option would be bringing on aUser and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)solution.These solutions analyze user and entity behaviors across an organization\u2019s network to identify deviations from normal patterns, which can help detect unauthorized access or unusual activities. Lastly, if you feel that someone is trying to use a zero-day exploit against you or your organization, you can execute suspicious file code in an isolated,sandbox environment; that will allow you to observe the code\u2019s behavior without risking the production network. Zero-day malware may exhibit unusual behaviors in these sandboxes, so it\u2019s a good way to root them out. How do You Protect Yourself Against Zero-Day Attacks? It\u2019s clear by now that zero-day attacks are no joke; these are incredibly dangerous zero-day exploits that can have widespread, long-term effects on all sectors. So what else can we do to protect organizations against zero-day attacks? Beyond having a proficient antivirus software and endpoint security solution deployed,proper employee trainingon these products and other related skills, such as log reading, will ensure that abnormalities are found as quickly as possible. This will play into having a strongincident response plan(IRP), which is the plan companies put in place for identifying and responding to security incidents, including potential zero-day attacks. By having a strong, well-maintained plan andincident response team, if your company does come under attack your company can properly conductpost-incident analysisto determine the attack vector, identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), and understand how the attack occurred. All of these preventative efforts will minimize the damage done by zero-day vulnerabilities in your environment. There is also the option tocollaboratewith other organizations, security researchers, industry groups, and government agencies toshare threat intelligence and informationabout zero-day attacks and newfound vulnerabilities. You can also participate incybersecurity forums and communitieswhere security vendors, researchers, and experts share information about newly discovered vulnerabilities and attack techniques.Subscribing to threat intelligence feedsand services that provide information about emergingthreatsand zero-day vulnerabilities. Staying informed about potential risks will significantly reduce the chance of being blindsided by an attack. Lastly, and most importantly (in my opinion, anyway), is keeping software up to date withpatch management. Keeping software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched promptly, reducing the attack surface and the likelihood of exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities.

The targeted device(s) exist in at least 2 of the groups with the \u201cAs soon as possible\u201d group being one of those groups. Instead of processing the assigned application immediately, the Intune Management Extension will wait until the next availability date to perform the app installation, completely ignoring the \u201cAs soon as possible\u201d assignment. There is no error code associated with this bug. Behavior with an Assignment Set to \u201cAs Soon as Possible\u201d Patch My PC was able to replicate this issue using the steps below. Create an Intune app with a requirement rule.A Patch My PC Intune Update creates an Intune Win32 app with a requirement rule.

Move to the Intune client and allow policy to process. This process can be sped up by running an Intune sync or restarting the \u201cMicrosoft Intune Management Extension\u201d service. When creating assignments as noted above, we expected the client to perform the application installation immediately due to the \u201cAs soon as possible\u201d availability assignment. However, we found that the IME would actually delay the application installation until the delayed assignment \u201cAvailability\u201d time. Behavior with an Assignment in the Past Patch My PC was able to create the desired installation timeline by creating a deployment in the past instead of using the \u201cAs soon as possible\u201d assignment.

How This Effects Patch My PC Customers Patch My PC contacted Microsoft about this bug on August 10th, 2023, and hopes for a speedy resolution. However, until a resolution is found, Patch My PC customers who utilize Intune updates and assign updates to multiple groups should ensure that at least one of the following conditions is met: Device groups for assignments each contain unique devices that are not in other assignment groups (for example: Devices that are members of a \u201ctest\u201d group, are not also members of a \u201cproduction\u201d group). Additionally, refrain from using the \u201cAll Users\u201d or \u201cAll Devices\u201d groups, as these groups will always contain members from other groups.Consider creating a \u201cProduction\u201d group that excludes the members of the other assignment groups\u2019 members.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/windows-11-feature-updates-deep-dive/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Under the Hood of Windows 11 Feature Updates: A Deep Dive into WUfB-DS Feature updates keep your Windows environment up to date, but knowing how they\u2019re deployed is key to avoiding delays. This blog breaks down what a feature update is, how to configure it in Intune, and what happens behind the scenes, from Intune to theWUfB-DS / Autopatch Service, and theDecision engineon the device itself. Let\u2019s start with a small introduction to Feature Updates first. (Trust me, things will get fun after the first paragraph) What is a Windows Feature Update? A feature update is a significant upgrade to the Windows operating system, such as moving from version 23H2 to 24H2. Unlike regular quality updates, which focus on bug fixes and security patches, feature updates introduce new features, performance improvements, and enhanced security. However, feature updates aren\u2019t applied during the Windows Autopilot out-of-box experience (OOBE). Instead, they kick in after the first Windows Update scan post-provisioning, usually within a day. This brings us to a critical decision: how do we ensure these updates happen in a way that balances control and automation? While it might seem tempting to use the \u201cUpgrade Windows 10 devices to the latest Windows 11 release\u201dsetting for simplicity, relying on this option means relinquishing control over which Windows version is installed. This lack of control can lead to potential risks for environments that need to maintain stability and compatibility, such as unplanned updates introducing compatibility issues with critical applications or configurations. By configuring a separateFeature Update Policy, you can determine the exact Windows version devices should upgrade to. This approach offers: Predictability: You can ensure all devices are on the same tested and validated version. Predictability: You can ensure all devices are on the same tested and validated version. Phased Rollouts (Rings): It allows you to stagger updates, testing on a small group of devices before wider deployment. Phased Rollouts (Rings): It allows you to stagger updates, testing on a small group of devices before wider deployment. Risk Mitigation: You can avoid introducing issues from untested newer versions. Risk Mitigation: You can avoid introducing issues from untested newer versions. Let me explain in more detail how aFeature Update Policyworks, why it\u2019s the better choice for maintaining control, and what happens when it\u2019s configured. We\u2019ll also look at how it integrates into the post-OOBE process to ensure devices are updated on your terms. Configuring Feature Updates in Intune Let\u2019s create aFeature Update for Windows 10 and laterpolicy. To do so, we only need to fill in some required settings. As shown above, I made sure to: I configured the feature update to be deployed as a required update and not as an optional update (which is also a possibility if you want your end users to do it themselves) I configured the feature update to be deployed as a required update and not as an optional update (which is also a possibility if you want your end users to do it themselves) I configured the option to ensure the update will be deployed as soon as possible (I hate waiting) I configured the option to ensure the update will be deployed as soon as possible (I hate waiting) When we configured the policy, we expected it to be sent to the device when it syncs with Intune, just like the regular Windows Update ring for Windows 10 and later settings, right? Or is something else happening after we created this policy? Feature Updates: The High-Level Architecture After creating the policy, this is what is going to happen in the background from a high-level flow: Define the Policy in Intune: Set the target version (e.g., 24H2) and assign it to your devices. Intune Registers the Device: Intune communicates with theWindows Update for Business Deployment Service (WUFB DS / Autopatch)via the Graph API.(It is all Autopatch these days) WUFB DS Registers with Microsoft Update: The service informs Microsoft Update that the client device needs the specified Windows version. Wait for the Next Update Scan: The next time the device performs a Windows Update scan (default interval is 22 hours), it fetches the update information from WUFB-DS / Autopatch. As shown above, most of the work is done by Microsoft services themselves. Once the device is registered and configured in the WUfB-DS / Autopatch service, it should be able to scan and retrieve the feature update. Well, at least that\u2019s the expected behavior. What if that isn\u2019t working? Windows Updates Feature Update Reports As most of the work is done on the service side, it\u2019s important always to check the Windows Feature Update Report to ensure the service knows about the device. One thing is for sure: the feature update will not be offered/pushed if the report doesn\u2019t mention the device. So, before you take your device apart and start troubleshooting why the feature update is not being offered, generate the Windows Feature Update Report first. If your device is on the list and in the pending or offering state, you are good to go. If not, patience is key. In addition to the Feature Update report, you could also examine this registry key to determine if the device is enrolled into WUfbDS / Autopatch. If the device doesn\u2019t indicate that theEnrollmentTypeisFeatureUpdateand it\u2019s missing from theFeature Update report, it\u2019s essentially stuck in no man\u2019s land. In some cases, recreating theFeature Updatepolicy has resolved the issue. So, if the device isn\u2019t showing up in the report, you have three options:Having Patience,recreating the Feature Update policy, or Trying tounenroll/enroll the device from WUFB-DS using Graph.If you want to know more about how to do so using the Graph API, please read this blog. https://patchmypc.com/troubleshooting-windows-feature-updates-with-graph Once the device is on the feature update list but the feature update is still not being offered (not scanned yet), we must look closely at what\u2019s happening on the device itself. To do so, we will start with some good old scheduled tasks. The Role of Scheduled Tasks When the device needs to contact the Microsoft Update service to find the latest Updates, it uses an old-school scheduled task to do this in the background. We can spot those scheduled tasks in the UpdateOrchestrator scheduled task folder. Default Behavior The scheduled scan task for Windows Update scans runs every22 hoursby default, with a randomized offset of+/- 4 hoursto prevent server overload. This means scans typically occur every 18 to 26 hours. You can see for yourself if you open the task scheduled and just start pressing f5 to refresh as a maniac. When doing so, you will notice that the \u201cnext run time\u201d changes constantly. Triggering the Update Process When the scheduled task is executed, it will: Triggers usoclient (Update Session Orchestrator Client)with theStartScanparameter:This command initiates a scan for updates.It invokes theUpdate Manager, the core engine for managing updates.

For example, updates won\u2019t install if the device is in active hours or running on battery power. More on this later on. Let\u2019s zoom in to the brains of the Unified Update Stack and what happens when the usoclient start scan is kicked off. The Update Manager: The Brain Behind Updates The Windows device\u2019s update manager is one of the most important parts of the Update stack. This manager coordinates all update-related actions and could be called the brain behind it all! Ow, wait\u2026 Microsoft thought the same thing. Here are a few examples of what the Update Manager is responsible for: Scans Update Providers: It checks registered providers like WUFB DS, WSUS, and Microsoft Update. Scans Update Providers: It checks registered providers like WUFB DS, WSUS, and Microsoft Update. Merges and Prioritizes Updates: Consolidates updates from multiple sources and determines which ones take priority.

Schedules Work: Ensures updates are executed at optimal times. Thedecision engine\u2026. Would you care to hear more about that one? As it really attracted my attention when looking at the update manager. The Decision Engine and Decision Table TheDecision Engineevaluates whether an update can proceed. It uses a Decision Table containing hundreds of rules to do this. It\u2019s pretty big\u2026. if you don\u2019t believe me download this TXT file below. It contains the whole decision engine and all the rules that apply. Download Decision Engine When looking at the decision JSON from the link above, this part corresponds to the start scan usoclient parameter. Here are some decisions that are part of the Start Scan decision flow: ActiveHours: \u00b7 If the system is within active hours, updates are deferred. If you want to be sure the Feature update gets applied, check the Active Hours you configured in your Windows Update rings! First Use: Minutes since first use: < 120 (update deferred for new devices). OOBE Completion: Updates won\u2019t proceed until OOBE is complete. It won\u2019t process until the OOBE Is Complete\u2026. That deserves a story on its own. If you want to know more about this registry key, check out this blog post. OOBE Complete: Why OOBECompleteTimestamp Delays Hotpatch Power Conditions: System on AC power: false (updates deferred if running on battery). System battery saver enabled: true (updates deferred to save power). The Feature Update Decision Flow Words.. all those words. For the people who are more graphical minded. This is the corresponding flow of how it looks like when the Usoclient kicks in and tries to start scanning when the device is just enrolled. It will show you how and which Decisions are made when the device initiates the scan to determine if and which feature update is available. With all the scan requirements in place, let\u2019s examine why the updates still can\u2019t be deployed with the start scan requirements met. Why the Feature Update is not getting deployed Common reasons for feature updates not rolling out as expected: Throttled: Throttled: As you have seen in the architecture in the flow above\u2026. Throttling can be one of the issues when the start scan is in progress\u2026 especially when your name is Rudy and you configured some not supported Windows Update Orchestrator settings to speed things up a bit. Guess what happens\u2026 when a scan will be attempted each minute even when the device is not totally ready to receive the featureupdate? Throttling will sure to kick in. Safeguard Holds: Compatibility blocks applied by Microsoft for known issues. And I guess with the latest Safeguard issue:USB devices that support eSCL scan protocol may not be discoverable.It is something to beware of.

Check theWindows feature update device readiness report.For example, my VM that is not liked by the service. With all the issues discussed, we still need to discuss the Detection Frequency policy. Detection Frequency If we want to speed things up, this policy can be configured to ensure theDetection frequencyis changed from the default 22 hours to a bit less. *There is a random variant of 0-4 hours applied to the scan frequency, which cannot be configured. After the first successful USOClient start scan, the \u201cschedule scan\u201d scheduled task will be changed from 22 hours to the number of hours you specified. As shown above, the scan task will be repeated every 3 hours, but we still need to add the \u201crandom variant.\u201d So, instead of the three perfect hours, we could get a bit more. Bringing It All Together The flow from Intune to the device: Policy Configuration: The admin sets the feature update policy in Intune. WUFB DS Processing: The backend evaluates and registers the device for the update. Scheduled Task Execution: The device runs usoclient.exe StartScan based on the 22-hour schedule. (which can be changed with the detection frequency after initial deployment of the device) Update Manager Checks: Conditions like active hours, safeguard holds, and power state are evaluated. Download and Install: If all conditions are met, the update proceeds. Conclusion Understanding the intricate flow of feature updates helps troubleshoot issues effectively. Whether it\u2019s safeguard holds, delayed scans, or active hours blocking updates, this knowledge equips you to pinpoint the problem and resolve it efficiently. With this process in mind, you\u2019ll be better prepared to manage updates in your Windows environment.

CMPivot It is a handy real-time querying tool built into Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr), which you might know as the old System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). With this tool, IT admins can pull live data directly from clients managed by ConfigMgr, making it great for troubleshooting and getting immediate insights. Whether you need to check installed applications, running processes, device properties, or other details, CMPivot lets you gather this info quickly without waiting for thehardware inventory cycleto run. A CMPivot query can also run when executed from the Intune Admin Portal if the ConfigMgr device is uploaded through CloudAttach or if the device is co-managed. To ensure a fair comparison, we will the queries directly from Intune on a co-managed device. Prerequisites and Permissions Because we are running the queries from Intune, there are a few key things to keep in mind before you can use it: CloudAttach :To manage devices from the Microsoft Intune Admin Center, you must configure CloudAttach (formerly known as TenantAttach) in ConfigMgr. This configuration uploads all devices to the Intune Admin Center, allowing you to manage them from there. Note:Ensure that all devices are uploaded to the Admin Center. Even if you choose not to co-manage the devices, you can still run CMPivot from the Intune Admin Center. Uploading the devices is enough 3.User accountpermissions: To use CMPivot, you need a hybrid user account from the Intune Admin Center.This account must have the minimum permissions in both ConfigMgr AND Intune to run this type of queries.Multiple components are involved in authenticating the user. TheAdmin ServiceREST API leverages theService Connection Point, which, in turn, uses the CloudAttach App Registration to sync the data between the on-premises site and Intune.When you run a query, theSMS_Notification_ServerConfigMgr component processes the request, and it forwards it to theSMS_Notification_Servercomponent. As a next step, a task is being sent from the Management Point to the client over the BGBServer (Fast Channel Notifications) component. It will fail if you try to run the query with an Azure AD account, even if it has Global Admin permissions. You\u2019ll get the error message shown in the screenshot below: If you want to grant someone permissions in ConfigMgr only to run queries, then you need to grant them the built-in \u201cCMPivot Administrator\u201d security role at least. The same user account must have an Intune role assigned.Global Reader permissions were enough to run a query when writing this article. Using CMPivot Once everything is configured, you can run your queries from the Intune Admin Center. Navigate to Intune Admin Center \u2192 Devices \u2192 Windows. You\u2019ll be able to select any ConfigMgr or co-managed device to run queries and access data in real time. CMPivot usesKusto Query Language(KQL). Here are a few examples: Installed Apps by Publisher Name:InstalledSoftware | where Publisher == 'PublisherName' Installed Apps by Publisher Name:InstalledSoftware | where Publisher == 'PublisherName' Installed Apps Not from Microsoft:InstalledSoftware | project Device, ProductName, Publisher, ProductVersion | where Publisher !like 'Microsoft%' Installed Apps Not from Microsoft:InstalledSoftware | project Device, ProductName, Publisher, ProductVersion | where Publisher !like 'Microsoft%' Devices with Less Than 10% Free Disk Space on C Drive:Disk| project Device, Name, Size, FreeSpace| where (FreeSpace * 100 / Size) < 10| where Name == 'C:' Devices with Less Than 10% Free Disk Space on C Drive:Disk| project Device, Name, Size, FreeSpace| where (FreeSpace * 100 / Size) < 10| where Name == 'C:' .NET Framework Versions with a summarized value as a result:Registry('HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4\\Full')| where (Property == 'Release')| summarize count() by Value .NET Framework Versions with a summarized value as a result:Registry('HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4\\Full')| where (Property == 'Release')| summarize count() by Value Many more examples can be found inthis Microsoft Learndocument. Limitations in the Intune Executing queries in the Intune portal is limited compared to the options in the ConfigMgr Console. Custom hardware inventory classes you collect data on won\u2019t appear in Intune. Custom hardware inventory classes you collect data on won\u2019t appear in Intune. While the data can be exported to a CSV file from both, Intune allows a maximum of 500 entries. While the data can be exported to a CSV file from both, Intune allows a maximum of 500 entries. From ConfigMgr you can create a collection directly from CMPivot with the devices resulting from your query. It is not possible to create Entra ID Security groups based on the query result.

KQL allows rendering charts. However, rendering charts is currently not supported in Intune. KQL allows rendering charts. However, rendering charts is currently not supported in Intune. Troubleshooting CMPivot for devices uploaded to the Admin Center This troubleshooting section pertains to devices uploaded to the Intune Admin Center, on which the CMPivot queries are executed directly from Intune. Relevant log files: CMGatewayNotificationWorker.log CMGatewayNotificationWorker.log CMGatewaySyncUploadWorker.log CMGatewaySyncUploadWorker.log BGBServer.log BGBServer.log CcmNotificationAgent.log CcmNotificationAgent.log View thisMS Docs articleto learn more about the log description and location.The article linked above describes the workflow in detail, as well as common and known issues. Issue example: Error: Unable to get device information. Make sure Azure AD and AD user discovery are configured and the user is discovered by both. Verify that the user has proper permissions in Configuration Manager. Although the error message is self-explanatory, we can check the CMGatewayNotificationWorker.log. The log shows us a (401) Unauthorizedexception message: To resolve the issue, ensure your account has the necessary permissions for both Intune and ConfigMgr. Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Rudy to find out what DeviceQuery can bring to the table. Device Query Unlike CMPivot, which is a ConfigMgr tool, the DeviceQuery feature in Intune leverages the power of Microsoft Graph and KQL for querying device data directly from the Intune portal. We will explain how Device Query brings a new dimension to real-time data querying, which you can use to troubleshoot a single device. Prerequisites and Permissions Before diving into Device Query, ensure Intune manages your devices, and as always, you need to make sure you have the necessary licensing in place: The Intune Advanced Analytics Add-on or The Intune Advanced Analytics Add-on or Microsoft Intune Suite Microsoft Intune Suite Please Note: Device Query is not the same as Device Inventory, which was recently announced! Device Query is for troubleshooting, Device Inventory is a reporting tool. Device Query is for troubleshooting, Device Inventory is a reporting tool. Device Query is not a free feature, Device Inventory will be a core feature! Device Query is not a free feature, Device Inventory will be a core feature! CMPivot vs Device Query CMPivot, IntunePivot, and DeviceQuery all sound similar, don\u2019t they? But if we look closer at the IntunePivot DLL located in the Intune Management Extension folder, we might discover something interesting. As shown above, the Device Query code mentions its father, CMPivot, quite often. So, if you are familiar with CMPivot, Device Query isn\u2019t that different. Shall we look at how we could use Device Query to start troubleshooting a device? Using Device Query To start troubleshooting a device, we need to navigate to the Intune Portal \u2192 Devices \u2192 All Devices. Select a device to run your query. DeviceQuery utilizes the Windows Push Notification service and KQL to fetch real-time data. In the example below, I will query the LocalUserAccount property to find out which local users are created on this single device. So, what happens when I press the magic \u201c run\u201d button? Let me start with a simple overview, which I will explain in detail. This is what happens when you click the \u201crun\u201d button to initiate a KQL (Kusto Query Language) device query. The device query will kick off the createquery Graph command. Intune to WNS: The Intune service sends a push notification request to the Windows Notification Service. (WNS) WNS to Device: WNS processes the notification and delivers it to the specified device. PushNotification-Platform Event Log: Upon receiving the push notification, the device logs this event in the PushNotification-Platform event log, specifically event 1225, indicating that the WNP (Windows Notification Platform) Transport Layer received a command. Intune Management Extension (IME): The IME on the device receives the notification and starts processing the base64 encrypted device query. KQL Query Execution: The device executes the KQL query to gather the required WMI data. IME to Intune: Once the device query is executed, the IME sends the results back to the Intune service. Result Processing: Intune processes and prepares the results for display in the Intune console. With the results being shown in the Intune portal, the device query\u2019s job is done. For additional KQL queries beyond the localuseraccount query used in our example, please visit this GitHub page. GitHub \u2013 ugurkocde/IntuneDeviceQuery: This repository contains a wide array of KQL Queries ready for you to easily copy, paste, and execute within Intune. Limitations of Device Query While Device Query is powerful, it also has some limitations Scope: Queries can be run only on individual devices, not device groups. Scope: Queries can be run only on individual devices, not device groups. The WindowsRegistry entity:fails to return the RegistryKey for root. The WindowsRegistry entity:fails to return the RegistryKey for root. 128 KB: The result string of any query is limited to 128 KB. If your query generates a result longer than this, it will be truncated. An error message will indicate the number of rows that have been truncated. 128 KB: The result string of any query is limited to 128 KB.

Max Amount of Characters:Each query can be up to 2048 characters long. If you receive a \u201cquery too long\u201d error, shorten your query to meet the character limit and try again. Performance: Queries might take longer due to the nature of cloud processing and the dependency of the WNS infrastructure. Performance: Queries might take longer due to the nature of cloud processing and the dependency of the WNS infrastructure. Despite these funny limitations, Device Query in Intune offers a modern, flexible approach to device management and real-time data insights. These insights could be very valuable when you need to troubleshoot the device but how to troubleshoot Device Query itself? Troubleshooting Device Query When you run a KQL device query and encounter the error message, \u201can error occurred. Try running the query again,\u201d you are in for some fun! The message itself provides little information on the cause. To troubleshoot this issue, we need to switch to the device itself. Step 1: Verify Push Notification Services (WNS) Step 2: Check the Intune Management Extension Notification error message and Channel Address: If the ChannelAddress is missing, the Intune Management Extension didn\u2019t successfully subscribe to the WNS channel. If the ChannelAddress is missing, the Intune Management Extension didn\u2019t successfully subscribe to the WNS channel. The Error Message could show you some more details The Error Message could show you some more details Step 3: Check PushNotification-Platform Event Log:Look for event 1225, which indicates that the WNP Transport Layer received a command. If the PushNotifications event log doesn\u2019t show you anything, the push notification wasn\u2019t delivered to your device. Step 4: Validate Cloud Notification Policies:Check the DisallowCloudNotification Policy: If it shows you the above DWORD, your device will not receive push notifications, and Device Query will not work with it! Step 5: Have patience!Wait 10 minutes after booting the device before performing a device query. If the Intune Management Extension log doesn\u2019t mention the fact that it registered the channel, it could take some more minutes before Device Query can be used. With this Device Query troubleshooting guide finished, it\u2019s now time for the final CMPivot vs. Device Query conclusion. Conclusion CMPivot and Device Query may look similar, but each serves its specific environment\u2014CMPivot for ConfigMgr and Device Query for Intune. Both tools provide powerful real-time data querying capabilities, helping IT admins troubleshoot and manage devices efficiently. Depending on your situation, use CMPivot for on-premises setups and Device Query for cloud-native environments to ensure optimal device management and troubleshooting.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/fixing-intune-entra-portal-status_access_violation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Fixing the Intune / Entra portal status_access_violation error code This short blog will demonstrate how a simple setting inMicrosoft Edge v126(Chromium) can disrupt your entire Intune experience as an IT admin when configuring policies. This issue results in the frustrating error:status_access_violation. The Intune Portal Status_access_violation Error Code As an Intune or Entra admin, you\u2019re likely familiar with configuring settings directly within the Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Entra Portal, often using Microsoft Edge (Chromium) for these tasks. I bet you use Conditional Access Policies to lock down your tenant, right? Well, so are we to protect the company\u2019s crown jewels! As shown below, after inspecting an existing Conditional Access policy in my test/demo tenant, I wanted to exit the screen by clicking the cross. The moment I clicked on the cross to exit the screen, an error occurred. This is what Microsoft Edge showed me. The error showed me that: This page is having a problem Error code: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION I could continue to log in after closing the error code and refreshing the Intune portal. However, it became evident that the Intune portal wasn\u2019t the only one giving me the STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION error code; the Entra portal also started acting weird and showing me the samestatus_access_violation error. To confirm that the issue wasn\u2019t specific to my device, I repeated the steps on multiple other devices, and each one displayed the same error when attempting to close windows in the Intune and Entra portals. The STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION Fix Fortunately,Patch My PCis here to help, and resolving this issue is pretty straightforward. With the latest Windows build, an existing accessibility option in Edge can cause the status_access_violation error when closing a (policy) window in the Intune and Entra Portals. To fix this persistent error, please open Microsoft Edge and navigate to: edge://accessibility Once you have opened the accessibility internals page, you must deselect the \u201cWeb Accessibility\u201dOption. After that, the web accessibility option is disabled; the other accessibility modes below will be automatically turned off. Before closing the screen, select \u201d lock the current accessibility mode from being changed except for this page\u201d If you don\u2019t select that option, the web accessibility option could be turned on again and with it, the same error code will reappear. After configuring the accessibility options in Edge, you can close the window. With these edge accessibility options disabled, thestatus_access_violation errorwill no longer show when exiting windows in the Intune and Entra Portals. Isn\u2019t that great? Problem solved! With the problem solved, let\u2019s zoom in on the root cause of this frustrating issue. Chromium V126 / V127 It seems thatChromium V126, released on June 13th, is the root cause of the status_access_violation errors we are getting within the Intune and Entra Portals. Updating your browser to the latest build typically resolves issues, but even after updating to the latest 126.0.2592.81 stable release, I continued to experience the same problems. Despite installing the latest Edge update, which didn\u2019t resolve my issues, I also attempted to download the v127 beta version. After installing the beta v127 release and reconfiguring the same Conditional Access policies, I no longer encountered the status_access_violation error. It appears that a bug was introduced with Microsoft Edge v126, causing these issues not only on Intune and Entra portals but also on other websites. With the v127 beta version (which is luckily supported), we now have three options to fix it (1 isn\u2019t a fix, though)! Install the Beta v127 version Disable the web_accessebility option. Wait until it\u2019s fixed in v126 of Chromium Edge Version 126.0.2592.113 Wait until it\u2019s fixed in Chromium v126. I guess that was indeed the only good approach to fixing the issue. After checking the Edge release notes, we will discover that some improvements were made with the release of Edge v 126.0.2592.113. Microsoft Edge release notes for Stable Channel | Microsoft Learn The release notes for this version now mention that they improved the reliability by fixing a renderer crash (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION) that occurred when using some sites with web content accessibility enabled. With this new Edge release, we only need to restart our Edge browser to ensure the latest version has been applied! After restarting Microsoft Edge for Business, it was updated to the latest version, and the status_access_violation error was fixed! Conclusion: The status_access_violation error in the Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Entra portals can be a big frustration and disruption for IT admins. Fortunately, a simple adjustment in Microsoft Edge\u2019s settings resolves the issue. By addressing this accessibility setting, you can ensure a seamless and efficient experience while managing your policies. With this quick fix, you can now focus on your work without unexpected status_access_violation errors!

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/there-was-a-problem-resetting-your-pc-remote-wipe/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Intune Remote Wipe: There was a problem resetting your PC This blog will discuss why relying solely on a remote wipe from Intune can be problematic, especially with Dell devices configured in RAID mode. We\u2019ll explore the issue behind it and provide a solution to ensure a successful reset so you won\u2019t end up with the \u201cThere was a problem resetting your PC\u201d error. Introduction to Remote Wipe The remote wipe option is a great feature in Microsoft Intune. It allows administrators to restore devices to factory settings, erasing all user data, apps, and configurations. This functionality is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information when a device is lost, stolen, or retired from service. How Remote Wipe Works When a remote wipe command is initiated from the Intune / MDM console, it sends a remote wipe signal to the device over the internet. Upon receiving the wipe command, the device performs a factory reset, restoring it to its original state. This ensures that any personal or corporate data on the device is permanently deleted. The whole flow is very easy. You don\u2019t need to run to the device with your installation media to reinstall Windows on your own. It will all happen automatically! Isn\u2019t that nice? Why Perform a Remote Wipe? Remote wipes are necessary in several scenarios, including: Lost or Stolen Devices: To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Employee Offboarding: To remove corporate data from the devices of departing employees. Device Repurposing: To prepare devices for new users by removing existing data and configurations. Security Breaches: To quickly mitigate risks by wiping compromised devices. For more information on how the Intune Remote Wipe works, feel free to read Microsoft documentation:Retire or wipe devices using Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn There was a problem resetting your PC While remote wipes are generally reliable, they can sometimes fail, especially on Dell Devices. When the device reboots after the remote wipe is initiated from Intune, Windows should typically start reinstalling on your device. Sometimes, the reset will fail, and the device could end up on this startup repair screen. As shown below, there are a few troubleshooting options, except resetting your PC or turning it off. After rebooting the device again, another error will appear: \u201cThere was a problem resetting your PC.\u201d The moment we receive this screen with the error message \u201cThere was a problem resetting your PC,\u201d it\u2019s obvious that the device hasn\u2019t been wiped. Without the device being wiped, things could become bad. How do we proceed? Are we going to perform a system restore? Are we going to just reinstall Windows? Or will we take a closer look to prevent this from happening again? You want to prevent this from happening because the moment you wipe the device, you will lose track of it. A common wipe issue with Dell devices is that they are shipped with default RAID (Intel Rapid Storage Technology) mode enabled instead of AHCI/NVMe. Dell devices are shipped with RAID on by default to ensure the device has the highest performance. (Well.. that\u2019s what Dell is telling us\u2026 In my opinion there is not a performance penalty when using AHCI) This could lead to a big problem because If WinRE lacks the necessary RAID drivers, this can interfere with the wipe process. How are we going to fix this? Disabling RAID in BIOS A solution could be to disable RAID in the BIOS settings. This changes the storage configuration from RAID to AHCI, which is generally more compatible with standard drivers included in Windows. However, be aware that switching to AHCI may impact system performance. To disable RAID: Restart your computer and enter the BIOS setup (usually by pressing F2, F10, or Delete during boot). Restart your computer and enter the BIOS setup (usually by pressing F2, F10, or Delete during boot). Navigate to the storage configuration section. Navigate to the storage configuration section. Change the SATA operation mode from RAID to AHCI. Change the SATA operation mode from RAID to AHCI. Save the changes and exit the BIOS. Save the changes and exit the BIOS. Again, disabling RAID isn\u2019t advised so, what\u2019s left? When we want to make sure that the device can be successfully wiped when the disk drives are in RAID mode, we can inject the drivers in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) The Fix: Injecting RAID Drivers with PowerShell To resolve this nasty Remote Wipe issue, injecting the required RAID drivers into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) can help the system recognize the RAID array during recovery, so it doesn\u2019t boot up in startup repair. We can do so by using the ReAgentC.exe /mountre command to inject theIntel Raid VST driversinto the Windows Recovery Environment. Here\u2019s a simplified process using PowerShell: When deploying this PowerShell script to your existing Dell devices, you no longer need to worry about whether the device will be appropriately wiped! With this PowerShell in place, you don\u2019t need to go through the hassle of trying to do a startup repair to get the operating system back on track. As shown below, the PowerShell script will export the installed driver on the device to a temp folder. After exporting the driver, it will add the driver to the WinRE. With the RAID drivers injected into the WinRE, the device could boot, start performing theactual wipe, and start reinstalling Windows. Conclusion Remote wipe is an essential tool for device management, ensuring data security and device readiness. However, issues like Dell\u2019s default RAID configuration can cause wipe failures. Administrators can ensure smooth and successful remote wipes by understanding these issues and implementing fixes, such as injecting drivers with PowerShell. Once the device has been wiped, you can rely onPatch My PC to make sure that all of your apps are reinstalled.

Then look no further than Microsoft\u2019s Windows Autopatch! In this blog post, we will cover everything you need to know to get started with Windows Autopatch, including how to set up and configure It and how to verify that clients are receiving their scheduled updates. Once you understand how this works, you will be able to set and forget all about your Windows and Microsoft 365 updates! What is Windows Autopatch? Windows Autopatch is a cloud service that automates the update process for Windows (Feature and Quality), Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Teams. It is available to organizations that have a subscription to Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 (or higher), AAD Premium, and Intune. Windows Autopatch allows the admin to manually assign or automate the process of creating testing rings of devices and then deploying updates to those devices. If no issues are found, the updates are then deployed to all eligible devices in the organization. This allows for proper vetting of updates to small \u201ctesting groups\u201d before deploying updates to the entire estate. What is the ROI of Windows Autopatch? So why should I spend the time implementing Windows Autopatch? Keeping devices up to date with the latest Windows security patches Windows Autopatch can help organizations keep their devices up to date with the latest security patches which can help to protect them from malware and other security threats. Improving productivity By automating the update process, Windows Autopatch can free IT professionals to focus on other tasks, which can improve productivity. Reducing costs Windows Autopatch can help organizations to reduce the costs associated with managing updates, such as the cost of labor and the cost of software licenses. What are the prerequisites and limitations? If you want to take advantage of the Windows Autopilot service, you must first consider the following and ensure you meet all of the prerequisites before enabling the service. Licensing Windows Autopatch is available to organizations with Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 or higher, AAD Premium, and Intune.

On the next screen, you will be prompted to provide contact information for the Primary and Secondary Admins. Microsoft will contact these admins if there are any issues regarding Windows Autopatch that your internal IT teams cannot resolve. Once completed, the Windows Autopatch Service will begin setting up and initializing your tenant\u2019s configuration. Allow some time for this process to finish, and grab a coffee since you are now one step closer to never having to worry about Windows or M365 updates again! You should be prompted to continue within 5 minutes. However, please note that setup is still occurring in the background, as shown in the Notification panel for your tenant. Once the configuration has been completed, you will see the notification below to continue registering your devices. 1. Register Devices with Windows Autopatch Now that your tenant has been enrolled with Windows Autopatch, it is time to register your devices! Admins can easily register devices with Windows Autopatch using the two methods provided: This registration process involves adding devices you would like managed by Windows Autopatch to theWindows Autopatch Device Registration group. This group was created during the setup process and is used by the service to register devices. Devices can be directly added to this group or nested in other Azure AD assigned or dynamic groups. Windows Autopatch will perform a device check every hour to try and find and register any new devices assigned to this group. Autopatch Groups is another way admins can register devices using the Default or Custom Autopatch groups. These groups are logical containers composed of 5 (default) up to 15 (custom) groups that make up the deployment rings. To enable Autopatch Groups (Preview), log in to theEndpoint Manager Portaland click theDevicesblade. From there, click onRelease Management>Autopatch Group (Preview)and agree to the preview terms and conditions. When you enable Autopatch Groups, the service will create aWindows Autopatch (Default)group, as shown below. By default, this group comprises five deployment rings and will try to pull in all devices from either the Classic registration group or any of your Device based dynamic or assigned security groups specified in the deployment rings. They are also configured with default deployment cadences for Windows quality and Feature Updates. The defaults can be customized by adding more deployment rings and Windows Update settings such as Deferrals and Deadlines. Note:User-based groups are not supported in Autopatch Groups. The group MUST be a device-based assigned or dynamic group. Device-based groups can only be associated with one Autopatch group and deployment ring at a time. This also applies across different Autopatch groups and deployment rings within the tenant. The defaults can be customized by adding/removing deployment rings and configuring the Windows Update settings, such as Deferrals and Deadlines. You cannot rename or delete the default group. Devices can be assigned either dynamically, manually, or both to the five deployment rings. Custom Autopatch groups can be created if the defaults do not meet the organization\u2019s requirements for update deployments. For more information on configuring a custom autopatch group, please reference Microsoft\u2019s Documentationhere. By default, the following rings will dynamically assign devices from the Classic Registration group or any device-based Security group. Rings 1-3 are dynamically assigned; however, you can assign device-based groups to those rings. The Test and Last rings must have groups assigned and do not support dynamic assignments. TheTest Ringis reserved for IT Admins who want to test the update releases as soon as they are available from Microsoft. This can also be used as a pilot group if Deployment Rings 1\u20133 are removed from the default group. TheLast Ringis reserved for VIP or C-Suite level management. This ring is intended as the final deployment after Ring 3 (Broad) has been deployed to most devices and has a deferral period of 11 days. This group can be used as a PROD deployment ring if Rings 1-3 have been removed. You can see the groups created during the Autopatch Groups setup process; if you navigate to theGroupsblade in the Endpoint Manager portal and search forAutopatch,you will see that the service has created ten groups. These groups are divided into two sections: the default security groups used by the service to deploy Windows Feature and Quality updates. Autopatch Groups cannot be used to manage M365 Apps, Teams, and Edge updates. Those products are managed through the Classic Experience at this time. Note:Do not modify the Azure AD groups membership types (Assigned or Dynamic). Otherwise, Windows Autopatch will not be able to read the device memberships of those groups. If the ownership is modified, you must add theModern Workplace ManagementService Principal as the owner of these groups. 2. Service-Based Deployment Rings The Service-Based deployment rings are explicitly used for updating the Autopatch service, device-level configuration policies, apps, and APIs needed for the core functions of the service. These groups can not be deleted or renamed. Modern Workplace Devices-Windows Autopatch-Test Modern Workplace Devices-Windows Autopatch-First Modern Workplace Devices-Windows Autopatch-Fast Modern Workplace Devices-Windows Autopatch-Broad 3. Software-based Deployment Rings The Software-based deployment rings are used solely for software update management policies, such as Windows update rings and feature update policies being used in the default Windows Autopatch Group. These are the default rings that devices will be assigned too once registered to the service. Windows Autopatch \u2013 Test Windows Autopatch \u2013 Ring1 Windows Autopatch \u2013 Ring2 Windows Autopatch \u2013 Ring3 Windows Autopatch \u2013 Last You can also manually check for devices that fall in either the Classic or Autopatch Groups by clicking on theDiscover Devicesbutton in theTenant Admin>Tenant Enrollmentblade. If you need to manually re-assign a device to a specific ring you can select the device and click on theDevice Actionsdrop-down menu. SelectAssign Ringto specify the ring you want to move that device too. Note:You can alsoDeregister Devicesin this drop-down as well. This will remove the device from Windows Autopatch. The device must then be removed from the default Windows Autopatch Device Registration group or other assigned/dynamic-based groups. We can see that the selected device has been moved to Ring1 from Ring3. Moving your devices using this method is recommended instead of deleting the device from the deployment ring security group and re-adding it to a different group/ring. Monitoring and Reporting Once you have your devices registered and assigned to their deployment rings, you can now sit back and relax untilPatch Tuesday! Microsoft offers various ways to stay informed regarding all Windows Features and Quality updates. To view the release announcements, login to the Endpoint Manager console, navigate to the Devices blade, and then Release Management under the Windows Autopatch blade. Here, you will see when Windows feature and quality updates will be available for the first rings (testing rings). For more information, you can click on any of those links to view the KB article related to that update. To view your Release Schedule based on your deployment rings, click on theRelease Scheduletab. Here you can view, customize, and pause your deployments for both Feature and Quality updates. Here you can see when your deployment rings will be available to download the updates and when the deadlines will be met. You can pause either Quality or Feature update deployments by checking theWindows Autopatch release groupand selecting pause. To view more detailed reports, go to theReportsblade underWindows Autopatchand you\u2019ll find reports for both your Windows Quality and Feature (Preview) updates. Windows Quality Updates Reporting On the report\u2019s homepage, you can view a complete summary of all your WIndows Autopatch-managed devices. You can easily view how many devices are healthy with the service and have/are receiving updates. You can also see how many devices have not been updated and which party (Microsoft or Customer) is responsible for acting on that device. Healthy Devices\u2013 The devices have checked in with Windows Autopatch and will receive all Windows Quality updates within 21 days of release. Microsoft ensures that 95% of all managed devices will be updated within that time frame. Not Up to Date (Microsoft Action)\u2013 The device has not checked into Windows Autopatch within the 21-day deployment period or is still on last month\u2019s quality update. Microsoft will try to resolve the issues within the 21-day deployment period. Ineligible Devices (Customer Action)\u2014If a device is flagged under this category,the IT admin must resolve the issues preventing it from receiving updates or registering with Autopatch. For more information on the Sub status, please visit the Microsoft Documentationhere. If you\u2019re looking to view which devices are having these issues, or have been updated fully, then click on theReportstab at the top of the screen to view more detailed reports. Clicking on theAll-Devices Reportshows us a breakdown of all registered and managed devices plus their update status and sub status. These reports can be exported to csv and filtered based on deployment rings and update status. Note:At the time of writing it is not possible to export Windows Autopatch reports via the Graph/RESTFUL API. Windows Feature Updates Reporting The Windows Feature Updates Report will show you the rollout statuses of all Feature update rings that are currently enabled and using the Windows Autopatch. On the summary page you can see a line graph breakdown of all your devices and their compliance status. To view information about why a device may not be updated, click on the number under that column. This will load a new tab showing you all the devices that are not updated and how you can possibly resolve that issue. Like the Windows Quality Updates, you also have more detailed reporting for the Feature updates. If you click on the Reports tab, you will have these two options available: Feature Update Status: We will provide a complete list of all managed devices and their compliance status for all deployed Feature Updates. This list can also be exported to a CSV file. Feature Update Trending:This will provide you with a line graph showing all of your managed devices and their compliance status. You can filter this by device count or percentage of updated devices. Autopatch Troubleshooting Now that you are all set up and using Windows Autopatch, what happens now when something goes awry? Since Autopatch is a managed service hosted by Microsoft, there is not much you can or need to do if things are not working as they should. At most, you will run into tenant registration issues when using the Windows Autopatch Readiness Assessment Tool. Those issues can be addressed by following Microsoft\u2019s recommendations in the error messages. Those errors and possible solutions can be foundthrough Microsoft\u2019s resources. Another point during the process where admins may run into issues is during the Device Registration phase. Many variables come into play when registering devices. Microsoft has pre/Post Device Registration Checks to verify that all registered devices meet the minimum requirements and prerequisites before and after being registered with the service. If any of these checks fail, then the device will be placed in a Not Ready state until an admin can address the issue. Devices registered with the service check in every 24 hours and will determine theHealthof the device using the following post checks: Conclusion Microsoft continues to expand the capabilities and features within Windows Autopatch and other services used for managing updates. They recently released Windows Driver Update Management for Intune, which allows Admins to manage and approve drivers across various devices. At the time of writing this blog, Autopatch only supports Microsoft\u2019s first-party patching. For all your third-party patching needs, I recommend checking out Patch My PC. Windows Autopatch groups are currently in preview, and Microsoft has released various improvements to Policy Health, Alert Notifications, and Reporting.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/fixing-caa2000b-aadsts500014-outlook-sign-in-failures/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Fixing CAA2000B / AADSTS500014 Outlook Sign-In Failures This blog is about an issue where the classic version of Outlook stopped signing in, throwingCAA2000B/AADSTS500014and4usqaerrors. The funny thing is that the new \u201cmodern\u201d Outlook worked fine, though, which made things even more confusing. We looked at the sign-in logs, tested new accounts, and eventually found what was really going on. The Outlook Error CAA2000B Outlook sign-in failures started appearing in multiple tenants without any obvious cause. Users who had been working normally suddenly received theCAA2000Berror /AADSTS500014(after the token expired). In other cases, new accounts failed to sign in entirely. Initial checks showed no service issues from Microsoft. Licensing and profiles were fine, and this time,SSL inspection or a proxy wasn\u2019t the culprit.The usual fixes like resetting credentials, reinstalling Office, and clearing cached profiles had no effect. At that point, the focus shifted to what was happening during authentication. The answer came from a closer look at the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs and a hidden dependency that I wasn\u2019t aware of. Creating a New Account ended up with error: 4usqa To rule out user-specific or profile-based problems, we created a new test account and tried signing in from scratch. The result was different, but not better. Instead ofCAA2000B, we were hit with a less familiar message:4usqa We also tested both versions of Outlook. Theclassic Outlookconsistently failed withCAA2000Bor4usqa,depending on the account state. However, when signing in using thenew Outlook app, everything worked. Which is pretty weird\u2026 is this how Microsoft wants to promote to start using the modern Outlook version? (just joking, of course) Checking the Sign-In Logs in Microsoft Entra From there on, we turned to Microsoft Entra to see what was going on under the hood. Looking at the sign-in logs, we found failure entries with the familiar user and timestamp. Thesign-in error code was 500014. When combining the sign-in log with the error codeCAA2000Bwhen opening Outlook, it became clear. Error500014means thatthe service principal for a required application is disabled. The failure reason stated: \u201cThe service principal for resource \u2018{identifier}\u2019 is disabled. This indicates that a subscription within the tenant has lapsed, or that the administrator for this tenant has disabled the application, preventing tokens from being issued for it.\u201d This pointed to a disabled service principal, but which one? TheCAA2000BClue Hidden in Plain Sight One of the failed sign-in windows showed a long string under a field labeledMicrosoft Information Protection API. Embedded in that string was a GUID. Running that value through the Entra admin portal revealed what we needed. The App ID 40775b29-2688-46b6-a3b5-b256bd04df9f was linked to theMicrosoft Information Protection API. And in affected tenants, this service principal wasdisabled. How This Broke Outlook with CAA2000B and 4usqa The Microsoft Information Protection API (MIP) is responsible for policy enforcement related to sensitivity labels, content classification, and encryption. It seems that the legacy version of Outlook silently contacts the MIP API Enterprise Application at startup, even if your tenant isn\u2019t actively using classification features. If the MIP API enterprise application is disabled, Outlook fails when trying to request the associated token. For previously signed-in users, this manifests asCAA2000Bduring token refresh. For brand new accounts, the result is4usqaduring the initial sign-in. In both cases, Outlook authentication is broken, and there\u2019s no visible link to Microsoft Information Protection API unless you go digging. Why Only Some Tenants Were Hit by CAA2000B Not all tenants experienced the issue. In those that did, the MIP API Enterprise Application had been disabled for some vague reason. I guess Microsoft is going to owe us a good explanation. How to Fix theCAA2000BProblem Once we knew the App ID, the fix was simple. Re-enable the sign-in of the Microsoft Information Protection API Enterprise Application. From Microsoft Entra: Go to Enterprise applications in the Entra Portal Remove filters to view all Enterprise Applications (disabled apps don\u2019t show up by default) Search for App ID40775b29-2688-46b6-a3b5-b256bd04df9f(Or Microsoft Information Protection) Open the Microsoft Information Protection API UnderProperties, setEnabled for users to sign-in?toYes Or use PowerShell: Once re-enabled, Outlook sign-ins started working again (takes about 5 cloud minutes)\u2026. so have some patience. But\u2026 please be aware of the fact that until Microsoft fixes this issue, you need to perform these steps a couple of times during the day to keep it enabled. As shown below, Microsoft tries to disable the account for this enterprise app, each couple of hours Microsoft\u2019s Incident Report Timeline for ex1072812 While analyzing these Outlook sign-in issues, Microsoft also acknowledged a broader service disruption that matches the behavior we saw. Issue summary:Recent updates to Exchange Online, aimed at improving how the classic Outlook desktop app operates, ended up consuming more processing power than expected. This caused backend resource allocation issues and led to performance degradation for some users. Due to the large number of affected users, the automated fix took time to apply. Microsoft advised using a manual workaround to restore access more quickly. A notification will be sent once the incident is fully resolved. Lessons Learned This wasn\u2019t an Outlook bug or a Microsoft outage. It was a disabled piece of the identity puzzle that most tenants don\u2019t even know exists. If Outlook starts throwing CAA2000B or if new users are blocked by strange errors like 4usqa, check your sign-in logs in Entra. Look forerror code 500014and trace the App ID. You may find that a hidden dependency was turned off.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-and-motherboard-replacement-why-a-deregistration-procedure-matters/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Autopilot and Motherboard Replacements: Why a Deregistration procedure Matters This blog explains what can go wrong when Autopilot devices aren\u2019t properly deregistered or offboarded and how something as simple as a motherboard replacement can lead to enrollment failures, tenant conflicts, and even serious security risks if the device ends up in the wrong hands. What You\u2019ll Learn Why motherboard replacements can break Autopilot identity How reused hardware can cause tenant conflicts The risks of improper deregistration, including security exposure Why Microsoft\u2019s old fix for this no longer works How to properly offboard Autopilot devices before hardware changes What role Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) plays and its limitations Introduction Windows Autopilot is a cloud-based service that simplifies the deployment and initial configuration of new Windows devices. It enables devices to be configured with the right settings, apps, certificates, and policies without needing to be reimaged. Instead of building custom OS images, organizations can use Windows Autopilot to automatically enroll devices into Intune and Entra ID as part of the out-of-box experience (OOBE). Before a device can be provisioned with Windows Autopilot, it must beregisteredwith your tenant. This is done by uploading thehardware hash, a unique identifier that includes details like motherboard serial numbers and TPM data (EKPub/EkCert). Once a deployment profile is assigned, the device will automatically configure itself with your organization\u2019s settings when it connects to the Internet.When the device contacts the Autopilot service (ZTD), it receives its assigned profile. When a Motherboard Replacement Breaks Identity A motherboard isn\u2019t just a piece of hardware, it holds something far more critical: your device\u2019s identity, embedded in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM is critical to how Windows identifies and trusts a device. It\u2019s used as the root of trust and plays a key role during Autopilot. Each TPM includes a unique Endorsement Key (EK) and often an Endorsement Certificate (EKCert), both used for attestation. This is essential forAutopilot Pre-Provisioning and Self Deployment scenarios. It allows Windows to securely enroll into Intune using Enrollment Attestation and proves the device identity during MDM enrollment and TPM key provisioning. But once the motherboard is replaced, so is the TPM. The original EKPub and EKCert are gone, breaking the trust link between the device and your tenant. The Autopilot service uses this trust (hardware hash/hwdeviceid) to identify the device. When you replace the motherboard, especially if the TPM is part of the board, the hardware hash/hardware changes completely. That means the device no longer matches the original registration. At that point, Autopilot provisioning fails. The service no longer recognizes the device\u2019s identity and won\u2019t assign the expected profile. Things get worse if that old motherboard is repaired and reused in another device The Cross-Tenant Collision: When Things Really Break Let\u2019s say: Device A (registered to Tenant A) has its motherboard replaced. The old motherboard is repaired and reused in Device B. Device B is owned by Tenant B. When Device B boots and connects to the internet during OOBE, Autopilot recognizes the hardware hash on that motherboard as belonging toTenant A. Autopilot sends downTenant A\u2019s deployment profile, and Device B tries to enroll in Tenant A. This is a hard block; you cannot enroll the device in your own tenant because it\u2019s still tied to someone else\u2019s. This is exactly what the infographic above shows. This has nothing to do with TPM attestation. It\u2019s all about tenant ownership. Security Risks of Motherboard Replacement Besides enrollment issues, there\u2019s a real security concern. If the replaced motherboard came from another organization and still has an active Autopilot registration with a self-deploying or pre-provisioning profile, it could automatically enroll into that original tenant. As soon as it connects to the internet, it will start applying policies, apps, Wi-Fi settings, certificates, or VPN profiles from another environment. This goes beyond a failed deployment. In the wrong hands, it could provide access to a different organization\u2019s network and could lead to a data breach. Microsoft was aware that hardware changes like this could break the Autopilot flow. To help with this, they had a backend solution that supported devices after a motherboard replacement. Microsoft\u2019s Attempt at Solving the Hardware Hash Problem At one point, Microsoft had a backend service that helped devices deal with motherboard replacements. When a device was already registered with Autopilot and had its motherboard repaired or replaced, the service would try to match the new hardware hash with the existing device record. As long as the device was still active in Intune and Entra ID and the registration was intact, the backend would accept the new hash as a replacement for the old one, effectively updating the existing Autopilot object. No manual intervention or re-registration was needed. This enabled devices to re-provision successfully after a motherboard swap without running into tenant assignment errors or hash mismatches. That behavior is no longer supported. Today, if the hardware hash changes, the Autopilot service no longer automatically updates it. If the device identity no longer matches, provisioning will fail, and the only way to fix it is to deregister the device and register it again from scratch. \u27a1\ufe0fFor a deep dive into how that remediation service used to work, check outthis blog post. That\u2019s why offboarding has become more important than ever. Motherboard Replacement: Offboarding: Before repairing a device, especially when the motherboard might be replaced, you must offboard/deregister it properly. That means: Remove the Autopilot registration Remove the device from Intune Remove the Entra ID object Wipe the device if it\u2019s still bootable If the device is totally broken and can\u2019t be reset, it\u2019s even more important to manuallyremove/deregisterit from the cloud. If you skip this, you lose control over the identity linked to that hardware. Once it\u2019s reused, the next tenant won\u2019t be able to claim it. If they try to register the device, they will get the error808 ZtdDeviceAssignedToOtherTenant,and you\u2019ll be the reason why. The device\u2019s motherboard is still linked to another Tenant! If this happens, you need to contact Microsoft Support. They can manually remove the device from the Autopilot service. If Microsoft Support needs to deregister the device on your behalf, they mustverify ownership of the device. Autopilot Device Preparation (AP-DP) You might be wondering, doesn\u2019t Autopilot Device Preparation solve this? It certainly improves the provisioning experience. AP-DP supports faster profile assignment usingEnrollment Time Groupingand removes the need to upload the hardware hash in advance. However, AP-DP still depends on whether the device is registered to a different tenant. If that motherboard and its identity are already claimed,AP-DP can\u2019t help. The enrollment will still fail because the device is effectively \u201clocked\u201d to the wrong customer, and the old method (Hash) still comes down to the device before AP-DP can be used. Final Thoughts If the motherboard gets replaced and the device wasn\u2019t properly deregistered, you might not be able to enroll it into your own tenant. It will keep trying to register with the original one.That\u2019s already bad enough. But if the original registration used aself-deploying or pre-provisioning profile, the device could automatically join the wrong tenant without any user action.This isn\u2019t just a broken enrollment. It\u2019s a real security risk. That\u2019s why you need a clear deregistration process in place before replacing or reusing hardware.

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/autopilot-hardware-hash-remediation/", "title": "", "raw_text": "Autopilot Hardware Hash Remediation: A Closer Look at Recent Changes This blog will focus on a recent Windows Autopilot change that was (not) announced:the Autopilot Hardware Hash Remediation changeand how it seems to be getting \u201cditched\u201d . Introduction to Autopilot Hardware Hash Remediation In one of my previous blogs, I explored Microsoft\u2019s introduction of the Autopilot Hardware Hash Remediation feature, which has the potential to greatly benefit many customers. This feature is handy when a Windows device undergoes a significant hardware change, such as replacing a motherboard. When the desktop motherboard is replaced, the Autopilot Hardware Hash Remediation feature automatically updates the device\u2019s hardware hash on the service side, ensuring that the device remains appropriately associated with the Tenant. When a hardware change is detected, a scheduled task initiates the process by updating the hash, allowing the device to continue functioning seamlessly within the Autopilot deployment process. If the Intune service detects an issue, the Intune portal displays a \u201cFix Pending\u201d message, indicating that the remediation process is in progress. This proactive approach simplifies the management of hardware changes and helps maintain consistency across your device fleet. At least, that was the whole idea behind it when this feature was introduced some time ago. Autopilot Profile Status After clicking on the Fix Pending message, it would show us that \u201cA hardware change was detected on this device. The message would tell you that they were working on it to register the new Hardware. The DetectHardwareChange scheduled task is central to this process. It creates a snapshot of the device\u2019s hardware specifications and stores data in the registry and disk. This includes essential files like cachedhash.txt and cachedtpmekpub.txt in the wmansvc folder. When a hardware change is detected, this task updates the registry and generates new files, triggering a report to the Autopilot service at ztd.dds.microsoft.com. Furthermore, the process relies on the Windows Notification Facility (WNF). This automatically detects hardware events and subsequently triggers updates. As a result, hardware changes are promptly detected and reported, maintaining the device\u2019s configuration integrity. Moreover, the remediation process provides significant benefits. It automates hardware change detection and updates, thus reducing the need for manual intervention and streamlining device management. Despite potential delays, this system is intended to offer a robust solution for managing hardware changes in Autopilot devices. But somehow, things changed? Hash Remediation Recent Changes On my birthday, Microsoft posted a small\u201cWhat\u2019s new in Windows Autopilot\u201dannouncement on Microsoft Learn. In the announcement above, Microsoft mentions that devices are no longer re-enrolled after a motherboard change. Furthermore, Microsoft seems to be moving away from hardware hash remediation, as they decided to strike through this text when they first announced it. Initially, when we removed the strikethrough, it stated: \u201cAutomatically re-enroll devices where hardware components (motherboard for example)may have been replaced with Autopilot auto-remediation if the OS has not been reset.\u201d This is consistent with what Microsoft mentioned in \u201cWhat\u2019s new in Windows Autopilot.\u201d Moreover, this change aims to prevent issues arising from unnecessary re-enrollment of devices after hardware changes, particularly motherboard replacements. I guess it\u2019s pretty obvious that this Hash remediation service is done for. Did Microsoft change anything in the code? When I look at a previous Autopilot.dll and compare it with the one from this year and June, I can\u2019t spot any real differences. The code to remediate the hardware hash is still in Windows and tries to detect if a hardware change occurred. So, I decided to test it out by moving a virtual hard disk from one VM to another. After the device booted up, the Autopilot Hash Remediation kicked in and mentioned that a change was detected and reported. Nothing showed up when switching to the Intune portal and watching for the \u201d hardware change detected\u201d notification. At first, I had the idea that Microsoft \u201cKilled\u201d the feature on the client side, but it seems Microsoft disabled the hardware hash remediation service on their side. Why did Microsoft ditch this hash feature? Why did Microsoft ditch this Autopilot Hash Remediation feature? I guess that Microsoft ran into a lot of issues with this feature. One of those issues was that vendors needed to beware of the Autopilot Marker with BIOS updates. Thisblog highlights how Lenovo BIOS updates can erase the Autopilot Marker, leading to hardware hash recognition issues. This could be the first reason Microsoft decided to \u201ckill\u201d the Autopilot Hardware Hash remediation feature. Another excellent reason why the Hardware Hash remediation was ditched could be the announcement of Autopilot Device Preparation. WithAutopilot Device Preparation, weno longer need the hardware hash. Without the hardware hash requirement, there is also absolutely no reason why we need Hardware Hash remediation. But still\u2026 I am pretty much wondering if there could be a third reason why this feature was ditched\u2026 Maybe we will hear more about it, maybe we won\u2019t. Conclusion In my opinion, Microsoft decided to ditch theHardware Hash remediation featurebecause it was causing more problems thanhelping to resolve hardware hash issues when a device got a motherboard replacement. I guess with this feature being shutdown, we are no longer going to experience the weird \u201d fix pending\u201d issue!..

{"url": "https://patchmypc.com/blog/remove-default-microsoft-store-packages", "title": "", "raw_text": "A Native Way to Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages This blog will focus on the new Windows 11 25h2 feature, \u201cRemove Default Microsoft Store Packages.\u201d It\u2019s a long-awaited Group Policy and (eventually) Policy CSP setting that finally lets you remove a curated list of inbox Microsoft Store apps (bloatware) natively, without requiring PowerShell scripts. If you\u2019ve ever wanted a cleaner, bloatware-free Windows deployment, this new policy is worth checking out. Why We Needed This (And What We Had to Do Before) For as long as Windows 10 and 11 have shipped with their full set of built-in Microsoft Store apps, there has been demand from IT and sysadmins for a clean, supported way to remove the extras. Think of Sticky Notes, Solitaire, Quick Assist, Xbox, Clipchamp, apps that most enterprises don\u2019t want to show up for new users. Until now, the only way was to script the removal, typically using PowerShell. I covered all the headaches of that process inthis previous blog. Scripting isn\u2019t just ugly; it\u2019s fragile. If you remove something Windows expects, you risk breaking the OOBE flow, tripping up Autopilot, or even causing the Enrollment Status Page to hang. What we\u2019ve been asking Microsoft for is anative policyto quietly clear these apps during provisioning, without requiring extra scripts, detection hacks, or timing nightmares. And now, it looks like that\u2019s finally happening! When looking at the latest insider preview, the Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages feature showed up! The New Policy: Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages With one of the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Dev builds (Windows 11 25h2), a new Group Policy setting showed up under: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > App Package Deployment The setting is calledRemove Default Microsoft Store packages from the system. It lets you pick from a curated list of built-in Microsoft Store apps that should be stripped out when a new user profile is created. No, you won\u2019t find Candy Crush or Spotify in there; this is Microsoft\u2019s own inbox app list. Here\u2019s what the UI looks like: Once you enable the policy and select your apps, Windows creates this registry key:HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages Each subkey corresponds to a selected app, using its package family name. The Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages Technical Flow: Here\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening under the hood, straight from the code (yes, we decompiled appxalluserstore.dll in IDA.Check out our video on YouTubeto find out more): The logic only runs if bothFeature_RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages(57056100) andFeature_UxAccOptimization(48433719) are enabled. You can enable them using ViVeTool. The feature (GetRemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackagesPolicy) checks the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages policy to determine if the policy is enabled. When a new user profile is created (as opposed to an existing one), the removal logic is triggered. The main function (AddAllUserApplicationsToDynamicArrayForUser) starts enumerating the apps that need to be removed for that user. For each app, the code walks through the subkeys in RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages. If the app matches a subkey and the policy is enabled, it\u2019s flagged for removal. The CleanupPackageFromPerMachineStore function is called:Copies the registry data for the app to a \u201cdeleted\u201d subtreeDeletes the provisioning info for that app from the machineMoves the app\u2019s files to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder Copies the registry data for the app to a \u201cdeleted\u201d subtree Deletes the provisioning info for that app from the machine Moves the app\u2019s files to a DeletedAllUserPackages folder If successful, the app is unprovisioned and shouldn\u2019t appear for new users logging in. The logic writes telemetry to theMicrosoft Windows AppXDeploymentServer Operationalevent log. If the policy or removal fails, you\u2019ll see detailed errors there. If you want to follow the process yourself, this all happens in appxalluserstore.dll and is orchestrated (and logged) by the AppXDeploymentServer provider. You can watch events in theMicrosoft Windows AppXDeploymentServer Operationallog. Go Beyond the UI and Remove Any App with PowerShell Right now, the only official option is through Group Policy. But you are not limited to just what the UI shows. As we noticed in the technical flow, Windows only looks for registry subkeys inHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\\RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages. If you add a package family name there, even if it is not in the official Group Policy list, Windows will remove that app for every new user profile. Why? Because the code to remove the apps just puts all the packages in one big array!.This gives you much more control. For example, if you want LinkedIn or Copilot removed, just add their package family names to the registry. The removal process will catch anything you list, not just what shows up in the Group Policy window. So, you are also not tied to Group Policy or a CSP. Since this feature is all registry driven, you can set it with a simplePowerShell script Here is what the Script will do. Create a subkey for each package family name you want removed Set a value calledRemovedPackageto 1 in each subkey SetEnabledto 1 at the base key Example: To remove LinkedIn and Copilot, add these: Add the PowerShell to Intune and assign it to all devices to ensure the script runs before the first user signs in, so the app removal occurs at the correct moment. The moment that PowerShell script is executed, the LinkedIn and Copilot app will be removed and will no longer be able to be executed. Bottom line: This approach offers more flexibility than the UI, and you can fully automate it today using PowerShell and Intune, without needing to wait for Microsoft to add CSP or Settings Catalog support. Set your script to run before anyone logs in, and you will achieve precisely the clean deployment you want. Results: Remove Default Microsoft Store Packages I set both feature flags with ViVeTool and enabled the policybeforeAutopilot enrollment. Sure enough, as soon as the device completed provisioning and the first user logged in, the removal ran. You\u2019ll see an event like this in the log (Event ID 327): RemovePackageList Microsoft.QuickAssist_8wekyb3d8bbwe Microsoft.Paint_8wekyb3d8bbwe Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe You get a perfect, machine-readable record of which apps were targeted for removal. Remove Default Microsoft Store PackagesKey requirement:This must all be in place before the first user logs in. It doesn\u2019t seem to do anything for existing profiles\u2026 But\u2026 The Apps Might Still Show Up (Broken) Here\u2019s the catch. Even with the policy and removal process in place, you\u2019ll often see shortcuts for removed apps still lingering in the Start menu or All apps list. Once you click on it nothing happens.. it is just stuck. The good thing? The app indeed is not launching! Event Viewer shows a flood of deployment errors (Event ID 698, AppXDeployment-Server) with error code0x80073D01for the failed apps. So, while the packages are truly unprovisioned, the UI/UX cleanup isn\u2019t finished yet. The Start menu displays \u201cdead\u201d icons, and users are unable to launch the apps. This rough edge just proves: the feature\u2019s backend is there, but the front-end polish isn\u2019t. Is it still in development? What About Intune and Policy CSP? There is a CSP path for this policy:./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/ApplicationManagement/RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages Since it lives under theApplicationManagement node,we\u2019ll likely see a native option to configure it in Intune in the future. However, as of now, the official Microsoft documentation hasn\u2019t been updated, and this setting is not yet available in the Intune Settings Catalog. No need to wait, though.As we showed above, because the policy is fully registry-driven, you can already deploy the exact same configuration using PowerShell and Intune. Just push your PowerShell script as part of Autopilot, and you\u2019ll get the same result as Group Policy, plus the flexibility to target any inbox app. When Microsoft eventually adds CSP and Intune support, you can switch to the native method. Until then, the PowerShell approach gives you all the control you need. How the Microsoft Store App Removal really works (or doesn\u2019t) If you are curious what really happens when this policy is enabled and whether apps are actually removed or just hidden, we took a closer look. It turns out it does not remove anything. Instead, it prevents the apps from being provisioned for new users. Want the technical details, the registry moves, and what is happening behind the scenes? Prevent Store App Provisioning: How it works in Windows 25h2 Summary: This Is the Cleanest Solution\u2026Once It\u2019s Ready If you want to remove default (or other) inbox Microsoft Store apps during provisioning, this new policy is the way to go. It\u2019scurated,only covers Microsoft\u2019s own list, not third-party junk. (But we can change that ourselves) It only works if you enable both feature flags and set the policy before any user signs in. The actual removal is logged in theAppXDeploymentServer Operationallog (Event 327 and errors as 698). It leaves some UI junk behind for now (dead Start menu icons). Still, this is the closest we\u2019ve come to a proper, first-party solution for eliminating bloat before users see it. Final note If you encounter any oddities or the policy doesn\u2019t work as expected, check those feature flags and review your logs. Please note that this is still an Insider-only feature and not yet ready for production. But for anyone tired of wrestling with PowerShell cleanup scripts, this is the most promising thing in years.

Overview of CVE Insights Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights Patch My PC\u2019s (PMPC\u2019s) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) product,CVE Insights, can help security, IT professionals, and end/home users easily stay up-to-date with CVEs that could affect their environments. Users can receive automatic notifications of all CVEs and configure personalized alerts. A very common issue in many organizations is that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Security team receive a lot of information from different sources, some of which is irrelevant. Once they\u2019ve worked out what is relevant, determining what actually needs to be done to address the CVE can be confusing, plus they don\u2019t have an easy way of checking if an applicable patch is available for a CVE and whether that patch has been deployed to their environment. Given that the CISO ultimately owns the risk, they need as much help as they can get. This is where our free CVE Insights mobile app can help as it provides executive-first friendly news snippets to help CISOs and their organizations figure out which vulnerabilities affect their environment. If you are a PMPC Cloud customer, you can optionally sign in to your PMPC Cloud Company from CVE Insights and easily view the patching status of all of your deployments that are affected by the CVEs you are tracking.

Overview of Cloud Update Rings Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud TheUpdate Ringsfeature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to deploy apps and updates in a phased manner across your Intune estate. For example, you may want to deploy software to a pilot group of users/devices to ensure it functions as expected. Then after a set period of time, you want to deploy the update to wider group of users/devices and pause a set amount of time to check for issues. Then finally, if there are no issues, deploy the update to the remaining users/devices in scope for the deployment. Although this approach increases the amount of time it takes to deploy software, it can reduce the impact of deploying software with unforeseen issues that impacts your business in undesirable ways.

Overview of Advanced Insights Inventory Extension Technical detail for the Inventory Extensions Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights The Inventory Extensions MSI is a .NETWMI Provider. This provider code is loaded by theWMI Serviceon Windows clients. The provider returns data that the client processes into a hardware inventory report where it is then submitted to the ConfigMgr site server and entered into the SQL database. WMIstands forWindows Management Instrumentation. It is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and applications in a network from Windows-based systems. WMI provides a standardized way for systems administrators to manage and query information about their systems. The heart ofWMIis theWMI Service, known asWinmgmtand part of the Windows OS, this service runs in the background on all Windows systems. This service acts as a broker betweenWMI Clients(ConfigMgr client) and theWMI Providers(Inventory Extensions MSI) that deliver the actual data. ConfigMgr's existing hardware inventory data is collected fromWMI. We simply extend ConfigMgr's default hardware inventory policy with the new definitions of our Inventory Extensions data. This allows the ConfigMgr clients to query ourWMI Providerthrough theWMI Serviceduring its normal hardware inventory task - just like it would for any existing hardware inventory class. For this reasonwe do not consider the Inventory Extensions MSI as an \"Agent\". We do not install any services on clients, instead the existing WMI Service brokers the connection between our Inventory Extension MSI code and the ConfigMgr client for us. The only time this code runs on clients is during a Hardware Inventory task or when a custom client action is invoked, after which theWMI Servicehandles the unloading of ourWMI Provider.

Mistakes here will cause issues in the future. Here are the access urls. When you have registered and logged in, you will be greeted by the home experience of HP Workforce Experience. On the left hand side, you will need to click \"Assets\" to begin importing your HP devices into HP Workforce Experience. HP Workforce Experience allows you to import your device using four different mechanisms. Currentlyonly Intune Import and Asset enrolment allow for warranty data collection, manual and csv upload do not trigger warranty collection by design. To begin importing devices, please click the \"Add\" button in the top left of the page. To begin importing from Intune, please click the Intune Import button then click next. You will be now asked to provide your Intune Domain Name, this can be found by going to the Intune portal, clicking Tenant Administration on the left hand menu and copying the Tenant name from the Tenant Status page.

You will be then presented the list of permission HP requests to perform the Intune import. All of the permissions requested by HP is for the HP Workforce Experience platform. They are not defined/requested by Patch My PC. Advanced Insights does not use or read any of your Intune data. Once you have accepted the permission, the connection to Intune will be completed by HP. You will now be asked if you wish to import Assets from Intune Groups, or to import all of your assets. We recommend you use the Group functionality, as this allows you to only provide HP the devices you wish to collect warranty information on. Only use full import if you really want every device in HP Workforce Experience as it is vendor agnostic and will collect all competing vendor devices. We shall continue using Group import only. When you click on Import assets only from Intune groups, you will be presented with a full list of all your groups in Intune. You can filter out the groups you want to import and you can import multiple groups. Select the groups you want to import and click Import. Intune will now begin importing your selected devices. You will receive a notification on begin and completion of the import. You can also check progress by navigating to the logs link on the left hand side. To enrol your device by Asset Enrolment, please use the following HP documentation to distribute the agent. Once the devices are imported, HP Workforce Experience will begin collecting warranty information. This process can take some time, depending on how many devices you have imported. Collecting warranty in Advanced Insights works in the same way as the other providers, but you will need to log into HP on bulk caching. Navigate to the warranty dashboard. To begin, click the \"Bulk Processing\" statistic to begin re-caching warranty. You will be asked to log in to HP, click yes and Advanced Insights will go to HP to log in. If you receive a redirect url is incorrect error. Please go back to your developer app and check the redirect url provided. Once you have logged in, HP will redirect you back to Advanced Insights and warranty will begin caching warranty data. Last updated3 months ago Was this helpful?"}

Tip: When first getting started with the product, it is recommended that you onlychoose one or two productsto reduce the time of the first sync and to validate your implementation quickly. We have found thatNotepad++and7-Ziptend to be great initial use case tests. To find and enable these products, you can search the list of updates usingCtrl + For by clicking on the magnifying glass in the lower right corner. When you select the search button a dialogue will open, type in one of our example products and hit enter, or clickOK. Once you have found the product you want to patch, click the checkbox for your preferred architecture choice and clickApply. Tip: You can right-click All Products, Vendors, or individual Products toapply custom installation optionsas described in the article below. If you happen to hitOKinstead ofApply, don't worry the publisher will close after saving the changes. You can just re-open and keep right on working. Next, you will need to enable the product in Configuration Manager to ensure the updates appear and become deployable via Configuration Manager. To do this first, you will need to complete a normal publisher sync. This will insert the updates into the WSUS database for each product selected. Once the updates are in the WSUS database, we will then need to pull them into ConfigMgr with a Software Update Point sync. You can run a publisher sync at any time from the sync schedule tab. Within that tab, there is an option to \u201cTrigger SCCM software update point sync when new third-party updates are published\u201d. With that option enabled, a Software Update Point sync will occur after the publisher sync. Alternatively, you can leave that box unchecked and run a SUP sync manually. Upon completion of the publisher and SUP sync a new product called 'Patch My PC' will become available in the software update point configuration tab. To reach this tab you will need to navigate to sites, right click the primary or CAS, select configure site components and choose Software Update Point. Note: If your SUP is remote, you will need to Configure the SMS Provider connection before running the publisher and SUP sync. This can be done under the Sync Schedule tab, by selecting \u201cConfigure SMS Provider connection..\u201d. Once this loads, select products and check the entire Patch My PC category.

Create an MSP App Set Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Important This documentation is under construction. Once it is finalized, this banner will be removed. Creating an App Set is a two-stage process that involves: Note We do not recommend creating a single App Set that you use to deploy all of the required apps to your customers. Instead, you should consider creating separate App Sets by app function, e.g., core apps (apps that should be installed or available everywhere), utilities that should only be deployed to certain groups or users, etc. Adopting this approach reduces the impact of working with App Sets on your infrastructure and that of your child companies. Plus, if someone accidentally deletes the wrong App Set, the impact on the targeted users will be reduced, and the time taken to recreate and redeploy the App Set will be reduced. To add apps to an App Set: Navigate toApp Sets Navigate toApp Sets TheApp Setspage shows any existing App Sets. ClickAdd App Set ClickAdd App Set On theAdd App Setscreen, enter a unique name for the new App Set in theApp Set Namefield and clickAdd On theAdd App Setscreen, enter a unique name for the new App Set in theApp Set Namefield and clickAdd The App Set is created and the<appset_name>screen opens (where<appset_name>is the name of the App Set). Tip You can clickEdit Namebeside the App Set name if you want to rename it. To add an application to this App Set, clickAdd Application To add an application to this App Set, clickAdd Application Note You can add up to 100 apps per App Set, but each app can only be added to an App Set once. You can also add anMSP Custom Appto an App Set, provided that app has been created and assigned to all customers. On theGeneral Informationpage, select the relevant app you want to add from theSelect Applicationdropdown or start typing its name. On theGeneral Informationpage, select the relevant app you want to add from theSelect Applicationdropdown or start typing its name. Note Only apps that have been deployed successfully will appear in theSelect Applicationdropdown. An MSP Custom App will only appear in theSelect Applicationdropdown if it has been added and assigned to all customers. If the Custom App has only been assigned to a specific customer or only to the MSP, it will not appear in the dropdown. In theDisplay Namefield, we suggest you add the name of the App Set as a suffix.For example, if the App Set\u2019s name isCore Appsand you are deploying Adobe Acrobat Pro, we recommend changing theDisplay Namefrom justAdobe Acrobat ProtoAdobe Acrobat Pro \u2013 Core Apps. In theDisplay Namefield, we suggest you add the name of the App Set as a suffix. For example, if the App Set\u2019s name isCore Appsand you are deploying Adobe Acrobat Pro, we recommend changing theDisplay Namefrom justAdobe Acrobat ProtoAdobe Acrobat Pro \u2013 Core Apps. Note The reason for the above recommendations is that by default, when an app in an App Set is deployed, if the app has already been deployed in your company, we automatically add the_AppSet<number>suffix (for example_AppSet7) to the deployment\u2019s name, where<number>is the next available sequential number. This is because all deployment names need to be unique. So in our Acrobat example, the default deployment name would be something like: Adobe Acrobat Pro_AppSet7 This is potentially confusing as you won\u2019t know which deployment belongs to which App Set. We are working on improving this.

Important You cannotEditorDeletea deployment from theDeploymentsnode if it belongs to an App Set (these options are unavailable when clicking on the ellipsis (\u22ee) beside the deployment). This is another reason for adding the App Set\u2019s name as a suffix to the app\u2019sDisplay Nameso that when you are viewing all of your deployments, you and the admins at your child companies can easily identify which deployment belongs to an App Set. Once the App Set has been deployed successfully, it will show aStatusofSuccesson theApp Setspage. Note Once successfully created, any deployments created as part of an App Set will be updated based on the Sync Schedule configured at each child customer. So even if you have a single App Set with deployments to multiple child customers, you can end up with different versions of the same app at different child customers depending on when theSync Scheduleruns.

Uninstall Cloud Branding Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud To uninstall any custom logos or localizations from your end-user devices installed by a Patch My PC (PMPC ) Cloud Branding App, you need to uninstall the relevant Branding App. Simplydeleting a Branding Apponly removes that Branding App from Intune. Creating anUninstall Branding Appcreates a Win32 app in Intune with aRequiredassignment with an uninstall intent, that will remove any PMPC Cloud custom branding files from the assigned devices. Important Each device can only have one Branding App installed. Even if you have multiple branding apps assigned to the same device, only the one that was installed last will be installed on the device.

One wayMicrosoft helps ensure an update is considered secure and from a trusted sourceis through the utilization of a code signing certificate. This requirement means all custom updates must be code signed before injection into WSUS. We provide three different ways to configure the certificate. In most organizations,allowing Configuration Manager to manage the certificateis acceptable and the easiest option. There may be external requirements that prevent the usage of self-signed certificates. To read our in-depth guide on certificates click the link below.

{"url": "https://docs.patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-cloud/cloud-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-cloud-deployments/browser-crashes-when-uploading-a-large-number-of-files-using-the-cloud-portal", "title": "", "raw_text": "Was this helpful? Browser Crashes when uploading a large number of files using the Cloud portal Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud I have a folder named \"MyFolder\" that contains 3,000 files, totaling 3GB. This folder needs to be available in the cache folder alongside the installer during installation. However, when I try uploading these files to a Custom App or as Extra Files for a deployment using the Patch My PC (PMPC) portal, my browser crashes. When too many concurrent worker operations occur during file uploads to either Custom Apps or even as Extra Files for a deployment, the browser's performance is significantly impacted, leading to freezing and eventual crashing. This is due to inherent limitations and is not related to the PMPC Cloud Portal but rather to browser performance constraints. To mitigate this, PMPC has limited the number of files that can be uploaded at once to 1,000. If you try to upload more than 1000 files at once, the upload will fail with the error message You have selected too many files (available: 1000) If you need to upload more than 1,000 files in one go, we recommend using the following workaround to compress them into a ZIP file and upload just this ZIP file as an Extra File. Then, when you deploy the app, you can configure a Pre-Installation script using the example below to extract the files. Consider the scenario mentioned above, where you have a folder named \"MyFolder\" containing 3,000 files totaling 3GB. This folder should be available in the cache folder alongside the installer during installation. Note If your scenario differs from the above, you should adjust the example scripts, ensuring you thoroughly test them. We provide no support for them or accept any liability for their use, which you do at your own risk. Please test these scripts thoroughly outside of the PMPC portal to ensure they work as expected before using them in your instance of the portal. Use the following PowerShell script to create a ZIP file. In this example, the folder to be compressed is located atC:\\Temp\\MyFolder Define the path to the folder you want to compress $sourceFolderPath = \"C:\\temp\\MyFolder\" Define the path where the zip archive should be created $zipFilePath = \"C:\\Temp\\MyFolder.zip\" Create the zip archive Compress-Archive -Path $sourceFolderPath -DestinationPath $zipFilePath -Force -ErrorAction 'Stop' After running this script, a file namedC:\\Temp\\MyFolder.zipwill be created. Create your Custom App or upload the ZIP archive as anExtra Filein a deployment. During the app deployment step, specify a script to extract the ZIP archive in the same folder. The script below uses the$PSScriptRootautomatic variable to determine the correct extraction path. Note $PSScriptRootis an automatic variable in PowerShell that represents the folder where the script is located. This ensures the ZIP file is extracted in the same location as the installation files. # Define the path to the zip file $zipFilePath = Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath 'MyFolder.zip' # Define the destination path $destinationPath = $PSScriptRoot # Extract the ZIP archive Expand-Archive -Path $zipFilePath -DestinationPath $destinationPath -Force -ErrorAction 'Stop' Upload the extraction script as a Pre-Install Script in your deployment settings. Finalize your deployment configuration. Finalize your deployment configuration. Test the deployment on a few machines before rolling it out to production. Test the deployment on a few machines before rolling it out to production. By following these steps, you can successfully upload and deploy apps containing a large number of files without encountering browser crashes. Last updated3 months ago Was this helpful?"}

Important Patch My PConlysigns helper scripts that we author for certain applications in the PMPC catalog. Any customer-provided scripts added using theCloud \"Scripts\" Deployment Toolwill not be signed with the Patch My PC code-signing certificate. Specifically for Intune detection and requirement scripts,AgentExecutor.exe(the Intune client process responsible for calling Win32 app detection or requirement scripts) runs in session 0; it is not visible by the logged on user and PowerShell is awaiting input by the user to accept the code-signing certificate. After 60 minutes, the Intune Management Extension service will timeout and terminate thepowershell.exeprocess with the below log entries in theIntuneManagementExtension.log. Note Microsoft do not expose this timeout to be configurable in Intune. PMPC utilizes \"helper\" scripts to perform both required and recommended pre/post actions for certain applications in the PMPC catalog. These helper scripts can, but are not limited to, help remove old versions of software if the vendor's installer does not handle this automatically. You have two ways to deploy either certificate from Intune: Note Important In addition, the computer must trust the certificate chain for the code-signing certificate, which is generally the case with certificates issued by public CAs. By importing the code-signing certificate's public key into the Trusted Publishers store, you ensure PowerShell can successfully verify and run the signed scripts.

How Cloud Update Rings Handle New Versions Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Let\u2019s assume you want to deploy an app in a controlled manner using Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud. First, you want to deploy the software to a pilot group containing a few users who want to test the software. Then, a couple of days later, once you are happy the app functions correctly, you want to deploy it to a different group containing more users. You could: Create a single deployment targeted to the pilot users group. Create a single deployment targeted to the pilot users group. Two days later, either:Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users.Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. Two days later, either: Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users. Modify the deployment targeted to the pilot users group to add the other group containing more users. Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. Create a new deployment targeted to the other group containing more users. This approach is admin intensive and relies on the admin remembering to create the deployment two days later to ensure the other group containing more users gets the app. Alternatively, you can create a single deployment and enable Update Rings with: One ring assigned to the pilot users group. One ring assigned to the pilot users group. A separate ring assigned to the other group containing more users, but with a two-day delay to allow the pilot users to perform testing. A separate ring assigned to the other group containing more users, but with a two-day delay to allow the pilot users to perform testing. How Update Rings behave depends on which Update ring Start Time you chose at the time of creating the rings: For this example, we will assume you want to deploy version 2019.1 of dBase: Initially to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Initially to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to thedBase All Usersgroup. Two days later, you want to deploy the software to thedBase All Usersgroup. This is how you would configure this deployment in the PMPC Cloud portal to useDelayedupdate Rings. In this scenario, when you deploy the app theDeploymentsnode is displayed along with theSuccess \u2013 Created <app_name>notification. Once the deployment has been completed successfully, if you look in the Microsoft Intune admin center underAll appsand search for the app, you will see that version2019.1has been successfully deployed. If you click the app and navigate toManage | Properties, then scroll down to theAssignmentssection, as you are using delayed update rings you will only see the assignments for the first Update Ring has been created and applied to this version. If you click on the deployment in the portal, then clickMore Info, then clickRing 2, you will see that this ring is scheduled to be created two days after the deployment was created. Two days after the deployment was created and after the next Sync Schedule runs, the second update ring will be created and the assignment added for thedBase All Usersgroup to install the software to all of the members of this group. You can now edit the deployment if required, as all of the rings have been created. If you also look at the deployment's properties, you will see that the second ring has been created successfully and assigned to thedBase All Usersgroup. As the following table shows, the software is installed immediately for any users in thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. Any users in thedBase All Usersgroup will not have the software installed until two days later. 0 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes No 1 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes No 2 dBase Pilot Users dBase All Users Yes Yes Now, let\u2019s assume a new version (2019.2) gets released.

We also use the release date of the new version to validate if it is the right time to update the assignments to upgrade rings to later versions. Once the deployment has been updated, you can now edit it as all of the rings have now been created. If you look at the deployment\u2019s properties, you will see that for theRing 1, version2019.2has now been assigned to thedBase Pilot Usersgroup. But if you click onRing 2, you will see that version2019.1is still assigned to thedBase All Usersgroup. If you check in the Intune admin center, you will now see both the existing app (version 2019.1) and the new version we have just deployed (version 2019.2).

Two days after the new version of the app is released and after the next Sync Schedule runs, the assignment for thedBase All Usersgroup will be automatically moved from the version 2019.1 deployment to the 2019.2 deployment, automatically upgrading the members of thedBase All Usersgroup to version 2019.2. The old version of the app (2019.1), will remain, but will no longer show asYesunder theAssignedcolumn in the Intune admin center. At the next sync, the old version of the app will be deleted.

Advanced Insights \"Home\" Dashboard Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced and Patch Insights The Home Dashboard is the first screen shown to you when first logging on to Advanced Insights. This page is designed to be a \"daily check\" type of view for your Configuration Manager environment, with a focus on software updates. The statistics across the top will show you details about your Configuration Manager environment and how long it has left in support, the number of devices in your environment which are under configuration, management versus devices that don't have the SCCM/ConfigMgr client install. We'll show you the number of updates in the environment which are required by at least one device, and we'll also show you any issues that you may be having with distribution of content across the Config manager infrastructure. As with everything in the Advanced Insights interface, you can click on any of these stats to see further information about the devices or the infrastructure that is listed behind them. For example, clicking the Managed Devices box, will show a list of the machines and their managed/unmanaged state. The next row of statistics are doughnut charts, which show you information about your Configuration Manager client count. In our demo environment we see that there are three devices running an old version of the client, two that are on a more recent version and everything else is fully up to date. The next doughnut chart shows us details about Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices, and their support status. This chart can be pivoted to some of the other metrics that we have about Windows 10 and Windows 11. So for example, the servicing channel and we can also see things like the editions and the release version. We can view all of the data used to build this chart by clicking the view chart data button under the cog icon. We also show the same support and edition information for the Office 365 client if you have that deployed in the environment. The chart on the right hand side will show us the status of the software updates scan cycle in your in your client estate. So here you can see that currently we have one machine which is running the software update scan and two have completed successfully. There are no errors. If everything is green in this chart, then that means that your software updates scan environment is healthy. The final row on the home dashboard will show as computer compliance, sorted by default by your least compliant computers from a software update perspective. We have several machines that have not sent in any software update compliance data for a while and so their compliance status is unknown against more recent updates. We can scroll through this list and can expand out the number of records that are being shown to show you a longer list. Clicking on any machine will take you to the detailed device view for that client where we show you the software update state for that individual machine. This view shows detail of update agent configuration and scan health as well as required and installed updates. The Actions row allows us to invoke client actions against the device, such as an update deployment evaluation, reboot, etc. The final view on the home dashboard is of deployed updates compliance. We have dedicated Software Updates dashboards for a more detailed view of this data, but on the home page we can see our least compliant updates, and we can click through to see significant detail about each object, its deployment state, etc. Last updated3 months ago Was this helpful?"}

Retention Policy (Deployments) Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Note Using theRetention Policytool is optional and is not supported by the MSP App Sets feature. TheRetention Policytool of the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployment wizard allows you to determine how many versions of an app (both Windows and macOS) you want to keep. If deploying a later version of an app causes issues, you can redeploy an older version. By default, PMPC only retains the latest version of an app in your environment. Configuring a Retention Policy allows you to keep the current version, plus the number of configured versions as set by the Retention Policy. For example, setting a Retention Policy of 1 for Google Chrome would mean you always haven-1versions of Chrome, the latest and the previous version, until a newer version is deployed. To configure a PMPC Cloud deployment to use a Retention Policy: Click theRetention Policytool. Click theRetention Policytool. Scroll down to theRetention Policysection. Scroll down to theRetention Policysection. In theVersions to Retainbox, either type the required number or use the controls to configure the number of versions of this app you wish to retain in your environment. In theVersions to Retainbox, either type the required number or use the controls to configure the number of versions of this app you wish to retain in your environment. Note The default value of0means only the most recent version of the app is retained. You can retain up to ten versions of an app. Tip SeeCheck App Version Retentionfor details on how to check within Intune that the correct number of versions of an app are being retained as defined in your Retention Policy. If you do not want to configure any of the optional tabs under theToolssection, clickNextto move to theAssignmentstab. Otherwise, click on the relevant tab underToolsto configure the required settings, which are explained in the relevant process. Note Other important points about App Version Retention: Modifying theVersions to Retainsetting is supported. The next time theSync Scheduleruns (or you manuallyupdate an app), the changes will be applied to the deployment. Deleting a deployment or disconnectingIntunewill delete the latest and all old unassigned versions of all of your deployments. Modifying an existing deployment with a Retention Policy configured will only affect the current version, not all previous versions. For example, if you edit a deployment and add an extra file, the file is only added to the latest version, not all previous versions. Modifying an existing deployment with a Retention Policy configured will only affect the current version, not all previous versions. For example, if you edit a deployment and add an extra file, the file is only added to the latest version, not all previous versions.

Devices marked asPersonalwill not send application inventory to Intune. For more information, seeIdentify devices as corporate-owned. When you connect your PMPC Cloud Company to your Intune tenant, we retrieve the latest copy of Intune\u2019sdiscovered appsreport, which contains an inventory of all installed apps on your devices. Note SeeIntune discovered appsfor more information on the Intune weekly scan. This report includes the following information about each app: Name Name Version Version Device count (how many devices the app is installed on) Device count (how many devices the app is installed on) Vendor i.e. who publishes the app. Vendor i.e. who publishes the app. We then perform a mapping process of the report\u2019s contents (based on the Intune app name and app version properties) to check if each app matches a publicly available app in our App Catalog or any Custom/Binary Free Apps you have uploaded.

Tip If you look in theEventsnode, you will see theIntune Application Discoveredevent which is created the first time Discovery is run in your PMPC Company. Intune only updates its discovered apps report once a week. Because of this, PMPC Cloud will initially query Discovery data for your tenant once a week, randomly selecting a day between 1 AM and 5 AM based on the time zone of your PMPC company.

Using Entra ID Security Groups in Cloud Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud supports the use of Entra ID Security Groups to control who has access to your PMPC Cloud company and which actions they can perform. Important Access through nested Entra ID groups is currently not supported. Once the Entra ID Security Groups feature has been enabled for your PMPC Cloud Company and provided you have successfully connected it to your Intune tenant, you will see theEntra ID Groupstab under theUsersnode. Important If the Entra ID domain used to sign in on our portal differs from that used in the Intune tenant connected to our portal, we do not allow sign-in using Entra ID group role assignments as we cannot match the domains. Using Entra ID Security Groups feature of PMPC Cloud allows you to: Note The following actions cannot be performed with PMPC Cloud and need to be performed from within Entra ID: Modifying the membership of a group (add or remove). Modifying the membership of a group (add or remove). Moving users between groups. Moving users between groups. Deleting groups from Entra ID. Deleting groups from Entra ID. Also, when you first set up a PMPC Cloud company, the user creating the company is automatically assigned theFull Admin with Access Managementrole. To avoid access issues (such as this user leaving your company and not passing on their credentials/setting up another user with this role), we recommend you either: Add an Entra ID Security Groupto the portal and assign it theFull Admin with Access Managementrole. Once you\u2019ve done this, we recommend you use Entra ID Security Groups to manage any additional users who need to have access to your PMPC Cloud company. Last updated5 days ago Was this helpful?"}

In the Administration node you will find the \u201cAudit logs\u201d area. This lists all activities in the Advanced Insights portal. The list is filterable by user and can be exported. You can now create new ConfigMgr collections using Advanced Insights. The Resources - Collections page has a \"Create New Collection\" button. You can also create a collection from a device list and automatically add the selected clients to a new collection or add to an existing collection. We have added a new function to allow you to delete profiles from client devices. This is useful in support scenarios for outdated or orphaned profiles. The delete action is also available in the device view - Users - User Profiles. For customers with BitLocker MBAM integrated with Configuration Manager we will now allow you to view the BitLocker Recovery Key in Advanced Insights. Users must have the relevant permission in their Advanced Insights role. The key is accessible via the Device View - Hardware - Disks tab. We now support the export of any of the tables in the device view. The new Configuration Manager console extension brings Advanced Insights right into the ConfigMgr console. Full documentation and download is herehttps://docs.patchmypc.com/installation-guides/advanced-insights-and-patch-insights/configuration-manager-console-extension We have included a new Log Builder application, this is integrated into the Installer wrapper and will execute automatically on failure. It can also be run manually from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Advanced Insights\\Api\\LogCollector\\AdvancedInsightsLogDiag.exe. When run it creates a zip file on the desktop with environment details and logs to aid Patch My PC Support in troubleshooting.

For example, a user can create a dashboard with objects from Resources, Hardware, Software Updates Trend, OSD, all in one view. Custom dashboards can also be shared with other users or roles (permissions permitting). We have made hundreds of SQL Cardinality statements to ensure SQL performance is consistent across different SQL Cardinality levels. New option to specify custom logos for the identity banner in the Advanced Insights portal. The logo file is what is shown when the menu is expanded, the Icon setting is shown when the menu is minimized. The new Local Administrators dashboard requires the Advanced Insights inventory extensions. The dashboard shows the groups and accounts that are members of the local admins group on all devices.

Prior to this release Software Metering reports required the legacy Configuration Manager Software Inventory Agent to be enabled and performing inventory of any executable you wished to report Metering data for. This is no longer the case, Advanced Insights now uses the InstalledExecutable class, which is part of the Asset Intelligence inventory provider. The legacy Software Inventory agent can be disabled if you were only using it to enable Metering reporting. Fixed bug with \"Patch My PC Actions\" not working for some customers. Look and feel clean-up Updated dependencies and DotNet version to DotNet 8. DotNet 7 components can now be removed from Advanced Insights servers (if not required by other applications).

How the Sync Schedule in Cloud affects Update Rings Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud As theSync Scheduleaffects when your portal checks for updates to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployments, how often it runs can also affect how your Update Rings behave. For example, if you have deployed an app that updates more frequently than your configured Sync Schedule, the ring with the lowest delay (for example Ring 1) will have the latest suitable version applied. Depending on how often you run your Sync Schedule and the delay between your rings, the scenario could arise where we have to skip versions to keep everything configured as per your ring strategy. If this arises, we will not deploy a version of an app to any rings that has not been deployed to at least Ring 1. This ensures we only deploy apps to later rings that have been tested on at least one ring. Also: If you create your Update Rings with anImmediatestart time, the Sync Schedule configuration only impacts the daily update of the rings and their assignments (promotion to the new version). If you create your Update Rings with anImmediatestart time, the Sync Schedule configuration only impacts the daily update of the rings and their assignments (promotion to the new version). If you create your Update Rings with theDelayedstart time, the Sync Schedule configuration impacts both the initial creation of the rings and the daily update of their assignments (promotion to the new version). For example, you create a deployment with two Update Rings with the default two-day delay between them. The first ring will be created when you deploy the software. The second ring won\u2019t be created until two days have passed since the time the deployment was created and the next Sync Schedule run. If you create your Update Rings with theDelayedstart time, the Sync Schedule configuration impacts both the initial creation of the rings and the daily update of their assignments (promotion to the new version). For example, you create a deployment with two Update Rings with the default two-day delay between them. The first ring will be created when you deploy the software. The second ring won\u2019t be created until two days have passed since the time the deployment was created and the next Sync Schedule run. The following table summarizes how yourSync Scheduleconfiguration determines how you can configure the delay between Update Rings. Daily Delays between rings can be configured as required. Weekly Ring 2 has to have a minimum delay of 7 days Ring x has to be configured with a delay of at least 7 days apart from any other ring. Monthly Ring 2 cannot have a delay of less than 31 days Ring x has to be configured with a delay of at least 31 days apart from any other ring. These limitations ensure that the update delays align with your chosen sync frequency and is why we advise configuring yourSync Scheduleto run on a daily basis when using Update Rings.

Manage MSP Users Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Managed Service Providers (MSPs) can manage users in both their own Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud company and any child companies they manage using the standardManage Usersprocesses. This includes inviting users of the child company to their PMPC Cloud portal. Any users created in the MSP parent company will automatically be assigned the same role in any child company, as child companies inherit user roles from the parent company. For example, if a user is created in the parent company and assigned theFull Admin with Access Managementrole, they will have the same role permissions in any child companies. Note Any accounts created in the parent company will not appear in any child companies. Also, if the MSP creates a new child company, no users are automatically created in the child company. Once an MSP has created a child company, users can request access to it by attempting to sign in to the portal using an email address that matches the one used to onboard the child company. The parent company admin will need to navigate to theUsersnode on the relevant child company to approve or reject any access requests. Note If the child company does not have any existing admin users, the access request email will be sent to the admin of the parent company. SeeManaging MSP Notificationsfor more details on how notifications, including emails are handled in MSP companies.

ConfigMgr Apps Getting started with Configuration Manager Apps. Please note, this portion of the guide is for base installations. For more in depth recommendations check out our configuration guides. Applies to: On-premises Publisher To activate any of the tabs in Patch My PC Publisher, the corresponding checkbox must be checked. If you do not check this option the product selection tree for the corresponding tab cannot be used. If you are using theConfigMgr Appstab, these options areNOToptional. You must configure them to be able to create applications. The application Options button has a lot of different features. This installation guide willnot cover the options in detailbut instead give you a quick, straightforward guide to getting the product installed. For more detailed documentation, click themore infolinks in the Publisher. Let's get started to begin, click theOptions buttonnext to the enablement checkbox. This will load the options panel in the Publisher. First Select the ConfigureSMS Provider connection. This is how you will ensure that the system where the Publisher is installed has access to the configuration manager site. Defining the SMS Provider is required, and it lets the Publisher know how to talk to your ConfigMgr site to create applications and trigger a software update point sync. By default, when a synchronization, the service will connect to ConfigMgr using SYSTEM context. Note: When running the Publisher, the ConfigMgr connection will be under the context of the user running the Publisher. After clicking theConfigureoption, the below pop-up will appear. Once you enter the name of the server selectTestto validate the configuration. Important: The connection to the SMS Provider is performed using theSYSTEM accountof the server where the Publisher is installed. If the server that the Publisher is installed on is remote from the SMS Provider, the SYSTEM Account of the Publisher server may need to be added to the SMS Admins Group, or DCOM permissions may need to be updated (More info) In the event the test result fails, you will instead see the following message. If the connection fails, clickCreate ConfigMgr Security Roleto automatically create a new security role with the minimum required permissions. Please see the article below for more details. Tip: If you need to create the security role, you will need to manually add the computer account to the role after it's automatically created as describedhere. Once you have completed a successful connection to the SMS provider selectOKto finalize the configuration. Next, you'll want to provide aUNC share to store the application content. This path needs to be accessible by the computer account of the machine running the publisher as well as the ConfigMgr site server, or a dedicated service account Important: As the Patch My PC Publisher will run in the SYSTEM context, therefore computer account the Publisher is installed on will need WRITE permissions to the share configured for source content of ConfigMgr Apps. When you choose a path, we will create a sub-folder calledApplicationsand then create a folder for eachvendorandproductin use. Keep this in mind when selecting the UNC path you will use to store source files. The above configuration would create the belowfolder structure similar to the structure below. Below are the default settings which will work fine for most setups. Our product provides a lot of customization options. To learn the details about all items on this page, check out thearticle below. Once you have the base options selected, you are ready to check out a simple application for testing. We recommend using 7-zip. Its small size makes it ideal for testing. Use the search icon in the bottom right or theCtrl+Fkey combination to search forIgor SelectApply.

By default, it will be set to 5 years but you can change the number of years the certificate is valid for. The other configuration you get from the publisher is that by default we do allow the private key to be exported. The benefit with that is that you do have the ability, if you move to a different WSUS server, to export the code-signing certificate generated through our tool and import that with the private key. This would allow you to use the same WSUS signing certificate that you were using on the previous WSUS server. That way you do not have to worry about potential clients having to get the certificate redistributed and trusted. The downside, from a security perspective, is that some people may not want that to be exportable because it could allow somebody to use that key in other places.

Overview of Migration Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud Important This feature is currently only available through an invitation-only Private Preview, as both it and the documentation are under development, incomplete, and subject to change. Please do not share links to these docs with others outside of the Private Preview. Once this feature is released, it will be announced and this banner removed. TheMigrationfeature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to migrate the following items from a Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) hierarchy to a PMPC Cloud company: Note We are currently focusing on just application migration, but we do plan to add the ability to migrate other types of objects from ConfigMgr as the Migration feature evolves. TheMigrationfeature is designed to support the migration of applications from Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) to Microsoft Intune, with a focus on modernization rather than simply transferring technical debt. As part of the migration process, we want to help you identify outdated applications or those exposed to known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). We will also make recommendations and assist in upgrading to the latest supported, secure versions available through the Patch My PC Catalog. All applications we migrate will benefit from an additional layer of customization to ensure they remain manageable, secure and fit for the modern desktop. We have two approaches for migrating applications from ConfigMgr to Intune: Wherever possible, we try to find a match for ConfigMgr applications to an app that already exists in our catalog, using various methods and metadata. If a match is found, you can then deploy this version to Intune rather than the older version, which may be vulnerable to exploits, out of support, etc. When we migrate ConfigMgr applications using this method, we include the migration of any installation arguments, customizations, and command lines you have in the ConfigMgr application. The end result is that you now have a version of the app deployed that can be managed and kept up to date for the life of that app. For those ConfigMgr applications that we cannot find a direct match to a version in our catalog, we can still migrate it, but as aPMPC Custom App. None of the properties, versions or other settings of the existing ConfigMgr application will be modified, but you will be able to modify and manage the app from within the PMPC Cloud portal and take advantage of the various customizations and features of PMPC Cloud Custom Apps.

Advanced Insights Configuration Manager Console Extension Adding Advanced Insights to the ConfigMgr Console Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights To provide easy access to all dashboards and individual devices, collections, updates, etc. Advanced Insights is provided with an optional Configuration Manager Console Extension. This adds a node to the Assets and Compliance view of the console as well as providing an additional option in the context menu when right-clicking certain object types in the console. Download and unzip the Console Extension using the link below. Warning: The console extension will not work if you are using aself-signed certificate. To import the Extension, navigate to the Administration node of the Configuration Manager console and expand the Updates and Servicing node. Right click Console Extensions and select \"Import Console Extension\". Browse to the location of the unzipped Console Extension download. Select the AdvancedInsightsConsoleExtension.cab file and click Open, then click Next, next and Close. The newly imported Console Extension will be listed alongside any other extensions you have deployed. You must now Approve the Extension by right clicking and selecting \"Approve\". Once approved the Extension can be Installed: You will be prompted to restart the ConfigMgr Console. When it reloads the Advanced Insights node will have been added tot he Assets and Compliance view: If Advanced Insights is installed on the same server as Configuration Manager, we will try to auto-configure the Extension, so this step may be unnecessary. When you click the Advanced Insights node, a dialog is displayed in the detail pane asking for the details of your Advanced Insights portal. Provide the relevant URL, including https:// prefix and any required port, for example https://server.contoso.com:444 and click OK. If the address is correct, the Advanced Insights login page will be displayed. You can re-run the configuration step any time by right clicking the Advanced Insights node and selecting \"Configuration\". The first obvious use of the Extension is to display the Advanced Insights portal right there in the ConfigMgr Console: The second use scenario is to access the rich display capabilities of Advanced Insights when working with Console objects. For example, right-clicking a client and selecting \"View in Advanced Insights\" will open a new browser window and automatically display the device view for that client.

Please do not share links to these docs with others outside of the Private Preview. Once this feature is released, it will be announced and this banner removed. Before you can perform a migration using the Patch My PC (PMPC) CloudMigrationfeature, you need to ensure that your On-Premises Publisher (Publisher) is connected to the same PMPC Cloud Company that you plan to migrate the objects to. Note SeeAdd a Connectionfor further details. You also need to ensure that theEnable Application Migrationcheckbox on theCloudtab is checked. Note If you do not see theEnable Application Migrationcheckbox on theCloudtab, ensure you are running the required version of Publisher as detailed inMigration Requirements. Important If you clickDisconnecton theCloudtab of thePublisher, all of the data for the Migration feature will be deleted from your PMPC Cloud company. You should avoid doing this until you have completed the migration of everything you need to migrate from ConfigMgr to PMPC Cloud. Next, sign in to your PMPC Cloud company and verify that theMigrationnode is visible. When you navigate toMigration, theMigrationpage is displayed, showing a list of the ConfigMgr applications that have been detected with the following information. Match Type The result of our attempt to match the ConfigMgr application to an app in our App Catalog, which will be one of the following: PMPC App \u2013We have successfully matched the ConfigMgr application to a version in our catalog. These apps can be deployed into Intune as a PMPC App and kept up to date by us for you.Custom App \u2013We have been unable to successfully match the ConfigMgr application to a version in our catalog, but we can still help you migrate it to Intune.Not Supported \u2013We cannot currently migrate the ConfigMgr application, such as PSADT, or an app we\u2019ve published from our Publisher to ConfigMgr, where it doesn\u2019t make sense to migrate it, as you can just deploy it straight from our catalog to Intune using PMPC Cloud.TIP:You can hover over the \u201c(i)\u201d for an unsupported match type to see why it is unsupported for migration. Matched App The name of the app we have matched the ConfigMgr application to in our catalog.

Info If there is further information/warnings about this application that we want you to review (such as we\u2019ve detected a setting in the ConfigMgr application we cannot migrate), a warning triangle is displayed in theInfocolumn. The triangle includes a number, which is the number of warnings. If you hover your mouse over the triangle, you will see a summary, and if you click the triangle, it will open the properties of the application and display the triangle beside the items we are warning you about. Clicking the triangle will show you more details that you should review before continuing to migrate the application.

You will now be asked if you wish to import Assets from Intune Groups, or to import all of your assets. We recommend you use the Group functionality, as this allows you to only provide HP the devices you wish to collect warranty information on. Only use full import if you really want every device in HP Workforce Experience as it is vendor agnostic and will collect all competing vendor devices. We shall continue using Group import only. When you click on Import assets only from Intune groups, you will be presented with a full list of all your groups in Intune. You can filter out the groups you want to import and you can import multiple groups. Select the groups you want to import and click Import. Intune will now begin importing your selected devices. You will receive a notification on begin and completion of the import. You can also check progress by navigating to the logs link on the left hand side. To enrol your device by Asset Enrolment, please use the following HP documentation to distribute the agent. Once the devices are imported, HP Workforce Experience will begin collecting warranty information. This process can take some time, depending on how many devices you have imported. Collecting warranty in Advanced Insights works in the same way as the other providers, but you will need to log into HP on bulk caching. Navigate to the warranty dashboard. To begin, click the \"Bulk Processing\" statistic to begin re-caching warranty. You will be asked to log in to HP, click yes and Advanced Insights will go to HP to log in. If you receive a redirect url is incorrect error. Please go back to your developer app and check the redirect url provided. Once you have logged in, HP will redirect you back to Advanced Insights and warranty will begin caching warranty data. Last updated3 months ago Was this helpful?"}
